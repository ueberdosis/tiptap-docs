import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

While the Pages extension is powerful, there are some current limitations to be aware of:

- **Tables** require you to import the `Table` extension from this package instead of the `Table` extension from our open source one.
- **No per-page styling** (all pages share the same layout and appearance).
- **No page templates** (every page uses the same structure).
- **No direct print/export integration** (Does not support browser print, but you can rely on our [our conversion extensions or endpoints](/conversion/export/docx/rest-api)).
- **Non-splittable content blocks**: The pagination system uses CSS floats to position elements around page gaps. Content blocks that create a [Block Formatting Context (BFC)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context) (such as tables, figures, or certain styled containers) cannot be split across pages. If such a block grows too large to fit on a single page, it will break the pagination layout. **Solutions:**
  - **Set Maximum Height:** Apply a `max-height` to large non-splittable blocks that ensures they fit within a single page. You can use the `--page-max-height` CSS property to ensure your element does not exceed a page boundary.
  - **Manual Node Splitting:** For content that needs to span multiple pages, split it manually into smaller nodes. Note that this approach introduces structural changes to your content and may affect the document's semantic structure.
- **No runtime dependencies**: All logic is self-contained in the extension.
