import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

While the Pages extension is powerful, there are some current limitations to be aware of:

- **Tables** require you to import the `Table` extension from this package instead of the `Table` extension from our open source one.
- **No per-page styling** (all pages share the same layout and appearance).
- **No page templates** (every page uses the same structure).
- **No direct print/export integration** (Does not support browser print, but you can rely on our [our conversion extensions or endpoints](/conversion/import-export/docx)).
- **No runtime dependencies**: All logic is self-contained in the extension.
