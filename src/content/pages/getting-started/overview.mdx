Tiptap Pages is a powerful extension that transforms your editing experience from a traditional single-block editor into a sophisticated page-based interface.

<CodeDemo isPro src="https://feature-pages-extension--tiptap-pro.netlify.app/preview/extensions/pages" />

With Pages, you can create documents that feel more like real pages, complete with proper margins, page breaks, and layout controls. This makes it perfect for creating documents that need to maintain a professional, page-based structure – whether you're working on reports, articles, or any other content that benefits from a traditional document format.

Key features of Tiptap Pages include:
- Page-based layout with proper margins and spacing
- Visual page breaks for better content organization
- Document-like editing experience
- Seamless integration with other Tiptap extensions
- Familiar interface similar to popular word processors

We are continuously improving the pages extension. Support for more extensions and other complex features are in active development.

## Limitations

### Non-Splittable Content Blocks

The pagination system works by using CSS floats to position elements around page gaps. This approach has specific requirements for how content elements must behave.

**The Issue:** Content blocks need to flow naturally around page boundaries. This works correctly when a block either:

- Flows naturally with the page layout
- Is a non-splittable block (such as tables, figures, or certain styled containers) but fits completely within a single page

Problems occur when a non-splittable block grows too large to fit on a single page. Since these blocks cannot be broken across pages by the float-based pagination, they will never fit properly, causing the pagination layout to break.

> **Technical Note:** Non-splittable blocks are typically elements that create a [Block Formatting Context (BFC)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_display/Block_formatting_context), which affects how they interact with floated elements.

**Solutions:**

1. **Set Maximum Height:** Apply a `max-height` to large non-splittable blocks that ensures they fit within a single page. This prevents elements from exceeding page boundaries. You can use the `--page-max-height` CSS property to ensure your element does not exceed a page boundary.

2. **Manual Node Splitting:** For content that needs to span multiple pages, split it manually into smaller nodes. Note that this approach introduces structural changes to your content and may affect the document's semantic structure.

When designing custom nodes or styling content, consider these limitations to ensure proper pagination behavior.
