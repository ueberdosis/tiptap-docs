Together with the Collaboration backend, providers serve as the backbone for real-time collaborative editing. They establish and manage the communication channels between users, ensuring that updates and changes to documents are synchronized across all participants.

Providers handle the complexities of real-time data exchange, including conflict resolution, network reliability, and user presence awareness.

The `TiptapCollabProvider` adds advanced features tailored for collaborative environments, such as WebSocket message authentication, debug modes, and flexible connection strategies.

## Set up the provider

First, install the provider package in your project using:

<Callout title="Set up private registry" variant="hint">
Note that you need to follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/pro-extensions) to set up access to the private registry.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/provider
```

For a basic setup, connect to the Collaboration backend by specifying the document's name, your app's ID (for cloud setups), or the base URL (for on-premises), along with your JWT.

Depending on your framework, register a callback to the Collaboration backend, such as `useEffect()` in React or `onMounted()` in Vue.js.

```ts
const doc = new Y.Doc()

useEffect(() => {
  const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
    name: note.id, // Document identifier
    appId: 'YOUR_APP_ID', // replace with YOUR_APP_ID from Cloud dashboard
    token: 'YOUR_JWT', // Authentication token
    document: doc,
    user: userId,
  })
}, [])
```

<Callout title="Note for On-Premises Customers" variant="hint">
  If you are hosting your collaboration environment on-premises, replace the `appId` parameter with
  `baseUrl` in your provider configuration to connect to your server.
</Callout>

## Configure the collaboration provider

The Tiptap Collaboration provider offers several settings for custom configurations. Review the tables below for all parameters, practical use cases, and key concepts like "[awareness](/collaboration/core-concepts/awareness)".

| Setting              | Default Value | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------- |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `appId`              | `''` (empty)  | App ID for Collaboration Cloud setups                                                                           |
| `baseUrl`            | `''` (empty)  | URL for connecting to on-premises servers. Used as an alternative to `appId` for on-prem setups                 |
| `shardKey`            | `''` (empty)  | Only use this if you use Tiptap Collab HA. Usually this would then be set to the document name, or a team id   |
| `name`               | `''` (empty)  | The document's name                                                                                             |
| `token`              | `''` (empty)  | Authentication token for secure connections. Supports strings, functions, and Promises                          |
| `document`           | `new Y.Doc()` | The Yjs document instance. Defaults to a new document if none is provided                                       |
| `user`               | `null`        | User ID or name for attributing changes to the document.                                                        |
| `forceSyncInterval`  | `false`       | Forces server sync at regular intervals, in milliseconds                                                        |
| `WebSocketPolyfill`  | `WebSocket`   | WebSocket implementation for Node.js environments. Use `ws` or another implementation                           |

### Optimize reconnection timings

The provider’s reconnection settings are preset for optimal performance in production settings. If you need to adjust these settings for specific scenarios, you can do so with our delay configurations.

Adjust initial delays, apply exponential backoff, or set maximum wait times to fine-tune your application's reconnection behavior, balancing responsiveness with server efficiency.

| Setting                   | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `delay`                   | `1000`        | Base delay between reconnection attempts, in milliseconds                                                                                              |
| `factor`                  | `2`           | Multiplier applied to the delay, increasing it exponentially after each attempt                                                                        |
| `initialDelay`            | `0`           | Time in milliseconds before the first reconnection attempt                                                                                             |
| `maxAttempts`             | `0`           | Maximum number of reconnection attempts. `0` means unlimited attempts                                                                                  |
| `jitter`                  | `true`        | Adds variability to the delay by randomly selecting a value between `minDelay` and the calculated delay for each attempt                               |
| `minDelay`                | `1000`        | Minimum delay when jitter is enabled. Has no effect if jitter is disabled                                                                              |
| `maxDelay`                | `30000`       | Maximum delay allowed between reconnection attempts. Set to `0` to allow the delay to increase indefinitely using exponential backoff (`factor`).      |
| `timeout`                 | `0`           | Time limit, in milliseconds, for each reconnection attempt before stopping                                                                             |
| `messageReconnectTimeout` | `30000`       | Time in milliseconds to wait for a server message before terminating the connection. If no message is received, the connection is closed automatically |

## Rate limits

To maintain system integrity and protect from misconfigured clients, our infrastructure—including the management API and websocket connections through the `TiptapCollabProvider`—is subject to rate limits.

### Default rate limits (per source IP):

- **Requests:** 100
- **Time window:** 5 seconds
- **Burst capacity:** Up to 200 requests

If you encounter these limits under normal operation, please [email us](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev).
