import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

You can define a URL and we will call it every time a document has changed. This is useful for getting the JSON representation of the Yjs document in your own application.

We call your webhook URL when the document is saved to our database. This operation is debounced by 2-10 seconds. So your application won't be flooded by us. Right now we're only exporting the fragment `default` of the Yjs document.

## Configure Webhooks

To configure webhooks for document and comments notifications:

1. Navigate to the [Collaboration settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) in your account.
2. Find the webhooks section and add your desired endpoint URL.

After adding your URL, the webhook is immediately live. You'll start receiving notifications for the specified events without any delay.

<Callout title="Add Comments support to your webhook" variant="warning">
  If you want to add webhook support for the comments feature and your Document server was created
  before March 2024, please upgrade your webhook as described [below](#enable-the-comments-webhook).
</Callout>

## Example payload

All requests to your webhook URL will contain a header called `X-Hocuspocus-Signature-256` that signs the entire message with your secret. You can find it in the [settings](https://collab.tiptap.dev/apps/settings) of your Tiptap Collab app.

```json
{
  "appName": '', // name of your app
  "name": '', // name of the document (URI encoded if necessary)
  "time": // current time as ISOString (new Date()).toISOString())
  "tiptapJson": {}, // JSON output from Tiptap (see https://tiptap.dev/guide/output#option-1-json): TiptapTransformer.fromYdoc()
  "ydocState"?: {}, // optionally contains the entire yDoc as base64. Contact us to enable this property!
  "clientsCount": 100,// number of currently connected clients
  "type": '', // the payload type (if the document was changed, this is DOCUMENT) ; only available if you are on webhooks v2
  "trigger": '', // what triggered the event (usually "document.saved") ; only available if you are on webhooks v2
  "users": [] // list of users who changed the content since the last webhook ("sub" field from the JWT)
}
```

## Retries

Webhooks are not retried by default, but you can enable retries by setting `webhook_retries` to `1` (see [Configure Runtime](/collaboration/operations/configure)).
The retry schedule is as follows:

- 1st retry: 5 seconds after the initial attempt
- 2nd retry: 15 seconds after the last attempt
- 3rd retry: 2 minutes after the last attempt
- 4th retry: 10 minute after the last attempt
- 5th retry: 30 minutes after the last attempt
- 6th retry: 3 hours after the last attempt

All retries include a header `X-Hocuspocus-Retry` with the current retry count. The `time` property in the payload is the timestamp of the initial attempt.

## Enable the Comments webhook

The webhook that supports comments is automatically enabled for all users that have created their account after March, 2024.

If your account was created before March, 2024 and you're using an older version of the webhook system, you'll need to manually enable the new comments webhooks. Here's how:

1. In case you’ve already implemented a previous Collaboration webhook, make sure to check the `type` and `trigger` fields when processing incoming webhooks.
2. Navigate to the [Collaboration settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) in your account.
3. Locate the Webhook section and click on the "Update" button.

This upgrade is necessary to accommodate the introduction of multiple new events being routed to the same webhook endpoint, distinguished by a new `type` and `trigger` field.

If you do not wish to use the comments webhook, no upgrade is necessary.

## Loader Webhook

In order to initialize documents, you can use the `webhook_loader_url` setting (see [configure runtime](/collaboration/operations/configure)). This URL will be called if a new document is requested.
The webhook will contain a header `Authorization` with your secret, and `document-name` with the name of the requested document.

If you return a yjs update (Y.encodeStateAsUpdate on your side), it will be applied to the document. If you return anything else, the document will be initialized with an empty document.
Note that the loader webhook is called only once when the document is created.

## Awareness Webhooks

If you want to get notified whenever a user connects to or disconnects from a document, you can enable awareness webhooks [here](/collaboration/operations/configure#settings-overview).
If you need the user parameter, please make sure to pass it to the TiptapCollabProvider, as mentioned [here](/collaboration/provider/integration#configure-the-collaboration-provider).

The events look like this:

```
{
  "trigger": "user.connected", // or user.disconnected
  "user": "user_1",
  "numConnectedUsers": 0,
  "appName": "",
  "name": "testdocument",
  "time": "2025-04-21T19:32:55.632Z",
  "type": "DOCUMENT"
}
```
