Snapshot Compare lets you line-up two document versions and highlights everything that changed. Use it to track edits, review contributions, and restore earlier states.

The Snapshot Compare extension adds extra functionality to the [Snapshots](/collaboration/documents/snapshot) by allowing you to visually compare changes made between two versions of a document so you can track what’s been added, removed, or modified. These comparisons are called _diffs_.

## Access the private registry
The Snapshot Compare extension is published in Tiptap’s private npm registry. Integrate the extension by following the [private registry guide](/guides/pro-extensions). If you already authenticated your Tiptap account you can go straight to [#Install](#install).

## Install

Install the extension from our private registry:

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-snapshot-compare@beta
```

## Settings

You can configure the `SnapshotCompare` extension with the following options:

| Setting              | Type                   | Default    | Description                                                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| provider             | `TiptapCollabProvider` | `null`     | The Collaboration provider instance                               |
| mapDiffToDecorations | `function`             | `() => {}` | Control mapping a diff into a decoration to display their content |

```js
const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
  // ...
})

const editor = new Editor({
  // ...
  extensions: [
    // ...
    SnapshotCompare.configure({
      provider,
    }),
  ],
})
```

#### Using `mapDiffToDecorations` for diff decorations

The extension has a default mapping (`defaultMapDiffToDecorations`) to represent diffs as ProseMirror decorations.
For more complex integrations and control, you can customize this mapping with the `mapDiffToDecorations` option.

**Example:** Applying custom predefined background colors to inline inserts

```ts
SnapshotCompare.configure({
  mapDiffToDecorations: ({ diff, tr, editor, defaultMapDiffToDecorations }) => {
    if (diff.type === 'inline-insert') {
      // return prosemirror decoration(s) or null
      return Decoration.inline(
        diff.from,
        diff.to,
        {
          class: 'diff',
          style: {
            backgroundColor: diff.attribution.color.backgroundColor,
          },
        },
        // pass the diff as the decoration's spec, this is required for `extractAttributeChanges`
        { diff },
      )
    }

    // fallback to the default mapping
    return defaultMapDiffToDecorations({
      diff,
      tr,
      editor,
      attributes: {
        // add custom attributes to the decorations
        'data-tiptap-user-id': myUserIdMapping[diff.attribution.userId],
      },
    })
  },
})
```

## Storage

The `SnapshotCompare` storage object contains the following properties:

| Key             | Type                  | Description                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| isPreviewing    | `boolean`             | Indicates whether the diff view is active     |
| diffs           | `Diff[]`              | The diffs that are displayed in the diff view |
| previousContent | `JSONContent \| null` | The content before the diff view was applied  |

Use the `isPreviewing` property to check if the diff view is currently active:

```ts
if (editor.storage.snapshotCompare.isPreviewing) {
  // The diff view is currently active
}
```

Use the `diffs` property to access the diffs displayed in the diff view:

```ts
editor.storage.snapshotCompare.diffs
```

The property `previousContent` is used internally by the extension to restore the content when exiting the diff view. Typically, you do not need to interact with it directly.

## Commands

| Command           | Description                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `compareVersions` | Diffs two versions and renders the diff within the editor          |
| `showDiff`        | Given a change tracking transform, show the diff within the editor |
| `hideDiff`        | Hide the diff and restore the previous content                     |

### compareVersions

Use the `compareVersions` command to compute and display the differences between two document versions.

```ts
editor.chain().compareVersions({
  fromVersion: 1,
})
```

#### Options

You can pass in additional options for more control over the diffing process:

| Key               | Description                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromVersion`     | The version to compare from. The order between `fromVersion` and `toVersion` is flexible |
| `toVersion`       | The version to compare to (default: latest version)                                      |
| `hydrateUserData` | Add contextual data to each user's changes                                               |
| `onCompare`       | Handle the diffing result manually                                                       |
| `enableDebugging` | Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting                                               |

#### Using `hydrateUserData` to add metadata

Each diff has an `attribution` field, which allows you to add additional metadata with the `hydrateUserData` callback function.

<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
  Do note that the `userId` is populated by the `TiptapCollabProvider` and should be used to
  identify the user who made the change. Without the `user` field provided by the provider, the
  `userId` will be `null`. [See more information in the TiptapCollabProvider
  documentation](/collaboration/provider/integration).
</Callout>

**Example:** Color-coding diffs based on user

```ts
const colorMapping = new Map([
  ['user-1', '#ff0000'],
  ['user-2', '#00ff00'],
  ['user-3', '#0000ff'],
])

editor.chain().compareVersions({
  fromVersion: 1,
  toVersion: 3,
  hydrateUserData: ({ userId }) => {
    return {
      color: {
        backgroundColor: colorMapping.get(userId),
      },
    }
  },
})

editor.storage.snapshotCompare.diffs[0].attribution.color.backgroundColor // '#ff0000'
```

#### Using `onCompare` to customize the diffing process

If you need more control over the diffing process, use the `onCompare` option to receive the result and handle it yourself.

**Example:** Filtering diffs by user

```ts
editor.chain().compareVersions({
  fromVersion: 1,
  toVersion: 3,
  onCompare: (ctx) => {
    if (ctx.error) {
      // handle errors that occurred in the diffing process
      console.error(ctx.error)
      return
    }

    // filter the diffs to display only the changes made by a specific user
    const diffsToDisplay = ctx.diffSet.filter((diff) => diff.attribution.userId === 'user-1')

    editor.commands.showDiff(ctx.tr, { diffs: diffsToDisplay })
  },
})
```

### showDiff

Use the `showDiff` command to display the diff within the editor using a change tracking transform (`tr`). This represents all of the changes made to the document since the last snapshot. You can use this transform to show the diff in the editor.

Typically, you use this command after customizing or filtering diffs with `compareVersions`, `onCompare`.

The `showDiff` command temporarily replaces the current editor content with the diff view, showing the differences between versions. It also stashes the content currently displayed in editor so that you can restore it later.

```ts
// This will display the changes that change tracking transform recorded in the editor
editor.commands.showDiff(tr)
```

### Options

You can pass additional options to control how the diffs are displayed:

| Key   | Description                    |
| ----- | ------------------------------ |
| diffs | An array of diffs to visualize |

**Example:** Displaying specific diffs

```ts
// This will display only the diffs made by the user with the ID 'user-1'
const diffsToDisplay = tr.toDiff().filter((diff) => diff.attribution.userId === 'user-1')

editor.commands.showDiff(tr, { diffs: diffsToDisplay })
```

### hideDiff

Use the `hideDiff` command to hide the diff and restore the previous content.

```ts
// This will hide the diff view and restore the previous content
editor.commands.hideDiff()
```

## Working with NodeView (Advanced)

When using [custom node views](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions/node-views), the default diff mapping may not work as expected. You can customize the mapping and render the diffs directly within the custom node view.

Use the `extractAttributeChanges` helper to extract attribute changes in nodes. This allows you to access the previous and current attributes of a node, making it possible to highlight attribute changes within your custom node views.

<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
  When mapping the diffs into decorations yourself, you need to pass the `diff` as the
  decoration&apos;s `spec`. This is required for `extractAttributeChanges` to work correctly.
</Callout>

**Example:** Customizing a heading node view to display changes

```ts
import { extractAttributeChanges } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-snapshot-compare'

const Heading = BaseHeading.extend({
  addNodeView() {
    return ReactNodeViewRenderer(({ node, decorations }) => {
      const { before, after, isDiffing } = extractAttributeChanges(decorations)

      return (
        <NodeViewWrapper style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
          {isDiffing && before.level !== after.level && (
            <span
              style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                right: '100%',
                fontSize: '14px',
                color: '#999',
                backgroundColor: '#f0f0f070',
              }}
              // Display the difference in level attribute
            >
              #<s>{before.level}</s>
              {after.level}
            </span>
          )}
          <NodeViewContent as={`h${node.attrs.level ?? 1}`} />
        </NodeViewWrapper>
      )
    })
  },
})
```

## Technical details

### Diff

A `Diff` is an object that represents a change made to the document. It contains the following properties:

| Property              | Type                                                                                                                    | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`                | `'inline-insert'` \| `'inline-delete'` \| `'block-insert'` \| `'block-delete'` \| `'inline-update'` \| `'block-update'` | The type of change made                                                                               |
| `from`                | `number`                                                                                                                | The start position of the change                                                                      |
| `to`                  | `number`                                                                                                                | The end position of the change                                                                        |
| `content`             | `Fragment`                                                                                                              | The content that was added or removed                                                                 |
| `attribution`         | `Attribution`                                                                                                           | Metadata about the change, such as the user who made the change                                       |
| `attributes?`         | `Record<string, any>`                                                                                                   | The attributes **after** the change; only available for `'inline-update'` and `'block-update'` diffs  |
| `previousAttributes?` | `Record<string, any>`                                                                                                   | The attributes **before** the change; only available for `'inline-update'` and `'block-update'` diffs |

### DiffSet

A `DiffSet` is an array of `Diff` objects, each corresponding to a specific change, like insertion, deletion, or update. You can iterate over the array to inspect individual changes or apply custom logic based on the diff types.

```ts
const diffsToDisplay = diffSet.filter((diff) => diff.attribution.userId === 'user-1')

// Show the filtered diffs in the editor
editor.commands.showDiff(tr, { diffs: diffsToDisplay })
```

### Attribution

The `Attribution` object contains metadata about a change. It includes the following properties:

| Property | Type                     | Description                                        |
| -------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `type`   | `'added'` \| `'removed'` | Indicates the type of change made                  |
| `userId` | `string` \| `undefined`  | The ID of the user who made the change             |
| `id`     | `Y.ID` \| `undefined`    | The Y.js client ID of the user who made the change |

You can extend the `Attribution` interface to include additional properties:

```ts
declare module '@tiptap-pro/extension-snapshot-compare' {
  interface Attribution {
    userName: string
  }
}
```

### ChangeTrackingTransform

The `ChangeTrackingTransform` is a class that records changes made to the document (based on ProseMirror's `Transform`).
It represents a transform whose steps describe all of the changes made to go from one version of the document to another. It has the following properties:

| Property | Type                   | Description                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `steps`  | `ChangeTrackingStep[]` | An array of steps that represent the changes made to the document |
| `doc`    | `Node`                 | The document **after** the changes have been applied              |
| `before` | `Node`                 | The document **before** the changes have been applied             |

### ChangeTrackingStep

The `ChangeTrackingStep` is a class that represents a single change made to the document, based on ProseMirror's `ReplaceStep` class. It has the following property:

| Property      | Type          | Description                                             |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `attribution` | `Attribution` | Metadata about the change, such as the user who made it |
