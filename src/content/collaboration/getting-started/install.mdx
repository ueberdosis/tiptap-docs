### Install Tiptap Editor

If Tiptap Editor isn't installed yet, run the following command in your CLI for React to install the basic editor and necessary extensions for this example:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-document @tiptap/extension-paragraph @tiptap/extension-text @tiptap/react
```

Once installed, you can get your Tiptap Editor up and running with this basic setup. Just add the following code snippets to your project:

<CodeDemo path="/Examples/Minimal" />

## Prepare your editor

To introduce team collaboration features into your Tiptap Editor, integrate the Yjs library and Editor Collaboration extension into your frontend. This setup uses Y.Doc, a shared document model, rather than just handling plain text.
Afterwards we will connect Y.Doc to the TiptapCollabProvider to synchronize user interactions.

### Integrate Yjs and the Collaboration Extension

Add the Editor Collaboration extension and Yjs library to your frontend:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-collaboration @tiptap/y-tiptap yjs y-protocols
```

Then, update your index.jsx to include these new imports:

```tsx
import './styles.scss'

import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
import React from 'react'

import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
import * as Y from 'yjs'

const doc = new Y.Doc() // Initialize Y.Doc for shared editing

export default () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      Document,
      Paragraph,
      Text,
      Collaboration.configure({
        document: doc, // Configure Y.Doc for collaboration
      }),
    ],
    content: `
      <p>
        This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.
      </p>
    `,
  })

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
}
```

Your editor is now almost prepared for collaborative editing!

## Start your Document server

1. **Activate a plan:** Begin a [free trial or choose a subscription](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/billing).
2. **Add an environment.** On your [Dashboard](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/), click the `Add environment` button, enter a name and pick the region that is closest to your users.
3. **Check the configuration.** As soon as you save the environment, your app boots up. Visit the [configuration page](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) to copy your AppID, API keys, and other connection details.

### Connect to your Document server

For collaborative functionality, install the `@tiptap-pro/provider` package:

<Callout title="Set up private registry" variant="hint">
Note that you need to follow the instructions [here](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/pro-extensions) to set up access to the private registry.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/provider
```

Next, configure the provider in your index.jsx file with your server details:

- **name**: Serves as the document identifier for synchronization.
- **appID**: Found in your [Cloud account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) after you started your app. For on-premises setups replace `appID` with `baseUrl`.
- **token**: Use the JWT from your [Cloud interface](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/configuration/document-server) for testing, but generate your own JWT for production.

<Callout title="Adding initial content" variant="hint">
  When integrating the Editor in a non-collaborative setting, using the method shown here to set
  content is perfectly acceptable. However, if you transition to a collaborative environment, you
  will need to modify how you add initial content as shown after the next headline.
</Callout>

Incorporate the following code to complete the setup:

```tsx
import './styles.scss'

import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
import React from 'react'

import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
import * as Y from 'yjs'

// Importing the provider and useEffect
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { TiptapCollabProvider } from '@tiptap-pro/provider'

const doc = new Y.Doc()

export default () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      Document,
      Paragraph,
      Text,
      Collaboration.configure({
        document: doc,
      }),
    ],
    content: `
      <p>
        This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.
      </p>
      <p>
        The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.
      </p>
    `,
  })

  // Connect to your Collaboration server
  useEffect(() => {
    const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
      name: 'document.name', // Unique document identifier for syncing. This is your document name.
      appId: '7j9y6m10', // Your Cloud Dashboard AppID or `baseURL` for on-premises
      token: 'notoken', // Your JWT token
      document: doc,
    })
  }, [])

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
}
```

After following these steps, you should be able to open two different browsers and connect to the same document simultaneously through separate WebSocket connections.

For a clear test of the collaboration features, using two different browsers is recommended to guarantee unique websocket connections.

### Initialize Content Properly

Upon implementing collaboration in your Tiptap Editor, you might notice that the initial content is repeatedly added each time the editor loads. To prevent this, use the `.setContent()` method to set the initial content only once.

```tsx
import './styles.scss'

import Document from '@tiptap/extension-document'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Text from '@tiptap/extension-text'
import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'
import React from 'react'

import * as Y from 'yjs'
import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
import { useEffect } from 'react'

import { TiptapCollabProvider } from '@tiptap-pro/provider'

const doc = new Y.Doc()

export default () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      Document,
      Paragraph,
      Text,
      Collaboration.configure({
        document: doc,
      }),
    ],
    // Remove the automatic content addition on editor initialization.
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    const provider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
      name: 'document.name', // Unique document identifier for syncing. This is your document name.
      appId: '7j9y6m10', // Your Cloud Dashboard AppID or `baseURL` for on-premises
      token: 'notoken', // Your JWT token
      document: doc,

      // The onSynced callback ensures initial content is set only once using editor.setContent(), preventing repetitive content loading on editor syncs.
      onSynced() {
        if (!doc.getMap('config').get('initialContentLoaded') && editor) {
          doc.getMap('config').set('initialContentLoaded', true)

          editor.commands.setContent(`
          <p>This is a radically reduced version of Tiptap. It has support for a document, with paragraphs and text. That’s it. It’s probably too much for real minimalists though.</p>
          <p>The paragraph extension is not really required, but you need at least one node. Sure, that node can be something different.</p>
          `)
        }
      },
    })
  }, [])

  return <EditorContent editor={editor} />
}
```

This ensures the initial content is set only once. To test with new initial content, create a new document by changing the `name` parameter (e.g., from `document.name` to `document.name2`).

## Disable Default Undo/Redo

If you're integrating collaboration into an editor **other than the one provided in this demo**, you may need to disable the default Undo/Redo function of your Editor. This is necessary to avoid conflicts with the collaborative history management: You wouldn't want to revert someone else's changes.

This action is only required if your project includes the Tiptap [StarterKit](/editor/extensions/functionality/starterkit) or [Undo/Redo](/editor/extensions/functionality/undo-redo) extension.

```ts
const editor = useEditor({
  extensions: [
    StarterKit.configure({
      undoRedo: false, // Disables default Undo/Redo extension to use Collaboration's history management
    }),
  ],
})
```

Following this guide will set up a basic, yet functional collaborative Tiptap Editor, synchronized through either the Collaboration Cloud or an on-premises backend.

## Authenticate your users

Learn how to secure your collaborative Tiptap editor with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). The next guide provides step-by-step instructions on creating and managing JWTs for both testing and production, ensuring controlled access with detailed examples.
