Tiptap Conversion lets you import and export Tiptap JSON to and from `DOCX`, `ODT`, and `Markdown`. You can integrate import/export directly in your Tiptap editor with dedicated extensions, or use the Conversion REST API on your server.

## Set up authorization

Most conversion operations require authentication. Generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) using the `secret key` from your Tiptap Cloud account. Include this JWT in requests or extension configs.

<Callout title="Export DOCX Extension" variant="info">
    The <code>extension-export-docx</code> package does not require authentication!
    Feel free to [skip](/conversion/import-export/docx/editor-export) these steps if you only need that extension.
</Callout>

1. **Activate a plan:** Begin a [free trial or choose a subscription](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/billing).
2. **Get your App ID and secret key** on the [Convert settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/cloud/convert) page.
3. **Generate a JWT** for testing using any JWT tool (e.g., JWT Builder). For production, always create JWTs **server-side** to keep your secret safe.
4. **Use the JWT** in your requests or extension config. For API calls, pass it in the `Authorization` header and the App ID in `X-App-Id`.

## Explore file-type integrations

Depending on which format you want to work with, each file type has its own guide to installing and configuring the relevant import and export extensions:

- [DOCX integration](/conversion/import-export/docx/)
- [ODT integration](/conversion/import-export/odt)
- [Markdown integration](/conversion/import-export/markdown)

These guides explain exactly how to integrate the respective extension and REST API endpoints into your application and configure any necessary options.
