## Import DOCX

`POST /v2/convert/import`

The `/v2/convert/import` endpoint converts `docx` files into Tiptap's JSON format. Users can `POST` documents to this endpoint and use various parameters to customize how different document elements are handled during the conversion process.

### Example (cURL)
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.tiptap.dev/v2/convert/import" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
    -H "X-App-Id: YOUR_APP_ID" \
    -F "file=@/path/to/your/file.docx" \
    -F "imageUploadCallbackUrl=https://your-image-upload-endpoint.com" \
    -F "prosemirrorNodes={\"nodeKey\":\"nodeValue\"}" \
    -F "prosemirrorMarks={\"markKey\":\"markValue\"}"
```

<Callout title="Subscription required" variant="warning">
    This endpoint requires a valid Tiptap subscription. For more details review our [pricing page](https://tiptap.dev/pricing).

### Import verbose output

The DOCX import extension provides a `verbose` configuration property to help you control the level of diagnostic output during the import process. This is especially useful for debugging or for getting more insight into what happens during conversion.

The `verbose` property is a bitmask number that determines which types of log messages are emitted. The extension uses the following levels:

| Value | Level   | Description                |
|-------|---------|----------------------------|
| 1     | `log`   | General informational logs |
| 2     | `warn`  | Warnings                   |
| 4     | `error` | Errors                     |

<Callout title="Verbose bitmask">
  You can combine levels by adding their values together. For example, `verbose: 3` will enable both `log` (1) and `warn` (2) messages.
</Callout>

The verbose output will give you, along the `data` property, one more property called `logs`, which will contain `info`, `warn`, and `error` properties, each of them being an array with all of the information related to that specific verbosity.

```js
{
  "data": {
    "content": {
        // Tiptap JSON
    }
  },
  "logs": {
    "info": [],
    "warn": [
      {
        "message": "Image file not found in media files",
        "fileName": "image1.gif",
        "availableMediaFiles": []
      }
    ],
    "error": [
      {
        "message": "Image upload failed: General error",
        "fileName": "image1.gif",
        "url": "https://your-image-upload-endpoint.com",
        "error": "Unable to connect. Is the computer able to access the url?",
        "context": "uploadImage general error"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Custom node and mark mapping

You can override the default `node/mark` types used during import by specifying them in the body of your request within `prosemirrorNodes` and `prosemirrorMarks` respectively. You would need to provide these if your editor uses custom `nodes/marks` and you want the imported `JSON` to use those.

For example, if your schema uses a custom node type called `textBlock` instead of the default paragraph, you can include `"{\"textBlock\":\"paragraph\"}"` in the request body.

You can similarly adjust headings, lists, marks like bold or italic, and more.
