Converting `.docx` files to Tiptap JSON is simple with the `@tiptap-pro/extension-import-docx` editor extension,
which integrates directly into your Tiptap Editor.

If you need to import `.docx` content outside the Editor, use the [REST API](/conversion/import-export/docx/rest-api).

## Install the DOCX Import extension

The Conversion extensions are published in Tiptap’s private npm registry. Integrate the extensions by following the [private registry guide](/guides/pro-extensions).

Install the Tiptap Import extension package:

```bash
npm i @tiptap-pro/extension-import-docx
```

Ensure your editor includes all necessary Tiptap extensions to handle content from DOCX. For example, include the Image extension for inline images, and the Table extension for tables.

## Required extensions
In order to fully map DOCX content (e.g. images, tables, styled text) onto Tiptap’s schema, you must include the relevant Tiptap extensions. Without these extensions, certain DOCX elements may not be recognized or properly rendered by the editor.

```js
import StarterKit from '@tiptap/starter-kit'
import Color from '@tiptap/extension-color'
import FontFamily from '@tiptap/extension-font-family'
import Highlight from '@tiptap/extension-highlight'
import { Image } from '@tiptap/extension-image'
import Link from '@tiptap/extension-link'
import Paragraph from '@tiptap/extension-paragraph'
import Table from '@tiptap/extension-table'
import TableCell from '@tiptap/extension-table-cell'
import TableHeader from '@tiptap/extension-table-header'
import TableRow from '@tiptap/extension-table-row'
import TextAlign from '@tiptap/extension-text-align'
import TextStyle from '@tiptap/extension-text-style'
import Underline from '@tiptap/extension-underline'
```

## Configure
Add the Import extension to your editor setup.

```ts
// Import the Import extension
import { Import } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-import-docx'

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    // Other extensions ...
    Import.configure({
      appId: 'your-app-id', // Your Convert App ID (see Tiptap Cloud settings)
      token: 'your-jwt-token', // JWT for authentication (see Authentication documentation)
      imageUploadCallbackUrl: 'https://your-image-upload-endpoint.com', // Your upload images endpoint
    })
    // Other extensions ...
  ],
  // Other editor settings ...
})
```

| Property | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `appId` | The ID of your Tiptap Convert app (find this in your Tiptap account's [conversion settings](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/convert-settings)) |
| `token` | A JWT authentication token generated by your server for the Convert service. (See the [Authentication guide](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/convert-settings) for details on obtaining and using these credentials.) |
| `imageUploadCallbackUrl` | An endpoint to upload images found in the DOCX. The conversion service will send each embedded image to this URL and use the returned URL in the content. And any images that cannot be handled will be stripped out. |
| `verbose` | A `string \| number` configuration property to help you control the level of diagnostic output during the import process. This is especially useful for debugging or for getting more insight into what happens during conversion. See more at [Verbose output](#verbose-output) |

## Import a DOCX file
Once the extension is configured, you can import a DOCX file selected by the user.

### Basic import
The simplest approach is to pass the file directly to the `import` command. Here it replaces the current editor content with the converted content and focuses the editor:
```js
editor.chain().focus().import({ file }).run()
```
In most cases, this one-liner is all you need to let users import `.docx` files. The extension handles sending the file to the conversion endpoint, retrieving the converted Tiptap JSON, and inserting it into the editor.

### Import handling
In order to have more control after the import process have finished, you would use the `onImport` callback to handle the conversion result. This callback provides the converted content, any errors that occurred, and a function called `setEditorContent` to insert the content from `context.content` into the editor. If you don't provide an `onImport` callback, the extension will automatically insert the content into the editor but you won't be able to handle anything else like errors or loading states.

```js
editor
  .chain()
  .import({
    file,
    onImport(context) {
      const { setEditorContent, content, error } = context

      // Add error handling
      if (error) {
        showErrorToast({ message: error.message })
      }

      // You could also modify the content before inserting it
      content.doc.content.push({ type: 'paragraph', content: [{ type: 'text', text: 'Hello!' }] })

      // You can change the loading state of your application for example
      isLoading = false

      // Perform the insertion in the editor
      editor.commands.setEditorContent(content)
    },
  })
  .focus()
  .run()
```

Operations that we have controlled in the example above:

| Operation            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Error Handling       | If the conversion fails, you can display a toast or log the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Content Modification | You can insert extra nodes, remove certain nodes, or otherwise adjust the converted Tiptap JSON as needed.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Editor Insertion     | If you want to rely on the extension's default insertion behavior (replacing the editor content), you can call the `setEditorContent()` function provided in the callback. If you modify the content yourself, you must manually set it with `editor.commands.setContent(content)`. |


## Verbose output

The DOCX import extension provides a `verbose` configuration property to help you control the level of diagnostic output during the import process. This is especially useful for debugging or for getting more insight into what happens during conversion.

The `verbose` property is a bitmask number that determines which types of log messages are emitted. The extension uses the following levels:

| Value | Level   | Description                |
|-------|---------|----------------------------|
| 1     | `log`   | General informational logs |
| 2     | `warn`  | Warnings                   |
| 4     | `error` | Errors                     |

<Callout title="Verbose bitmask">
  You can combine levels by adding their values together. For example, `verbose: 3` will enable both `log` (1) and `warn` (2) messages.
</Callout>

The verbose output will give you, along the `data` property, one more property called `logs`, which will contain `info`, `warn`, and `error` properties, each of them being an array with all of the information related to that specific verbosity.

```js
{
  "data": {
    "content": {
        // Tiptap JSON
    }
  },
  "logs": {
    "info": [],
    "warn": [
      {
        "message": "Image file not found in media files",
        "fileName": "image1.gif",
        "availableMediaFiles": []
      }
    ],
    "error": [
      {
        "message": "Image upload failed: General error",
        "fileName": "image1.gif",
        "url": "https://your-image-upload-endpoint.com",
        "error": "Unable to connect. Is the computer able to access the url?",
        "context": "uploadImage general error"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Support & Limitations
Importing `.docx` files into Tiptap provides a way to handle most standard Word content, but **it’s not a one-to-one mapping** due to inherent differences between DOCX formatting and Tiptap’s CSS-based styles.
