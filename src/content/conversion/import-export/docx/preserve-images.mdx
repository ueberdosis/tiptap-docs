Some documents that you're importing may include images that you may want to preserve in the converted document.

<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
    Tiptap does not provide an image upload service. You will need to implement your own server to
    handle image uploads.
</Callout>

## Import images

If you import a DOCX file that has images, the conversion service can include those images in the resulting Tiptap JSON only if you provide an image upload callback URL.

This is a URL endpoint on your server that the conversion service will use to offload images during the import process.

```js
 import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
 import { Import } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-import-docx'

 const editor = new Editor({
   // ... other editor options,
   extensions: [
     Import.configure({
       appId: '<your-app-id>',
       token: '<your-jwt>',
       imageUploadCallbackUrl: 'https://your-server.com/upload-image'
     })
   ]
 })
 ```
In this configuration, `imageUploadCallbackUrl` is set to an endpoint (e.g., on your server) that will handle receiving image files. If this is not provided, the importer will strip out images from the document.

When an import is triggered, the conversion service will upload each embedded image to the URL you provided.

### Callback process
This endpoint can be implemented with any web framework or cloud function. The key steps you need to integrate are:

1. **Receive the file:** The request will contain the image file data which you will need to parse on your server.
2. **Store the image:** Save the image to a location that is accessible via URL. This could be an AWS S3 bucket, a storage service like Cloudinary, or a public folder on your server. Generate a public URL or path for the saved file.
3. **Return the URL:** Send back a JSON response containing the image’s URL. For example: `{ "url": "https://my-cdn.com/uploads/unique-image-name.png" }`. Make sure to send an HTTP 200 status. The converter will use the provided URL in the editor content.

The Tiptap conversion service then takes that URL and inserts it into the Tiptap JSON as the `src` of an image node.

### Important considerations
- **Public accessibility:** The endpoint URL you provide must be reachable from the internet, since Tiptap’s cloud service will call it. It cannot be localhost or behind a firewall. Likewise, the returned image URL should be publicly accessible (or at least accessible to anyone who needs to view the document)
- **Correct response format:** Your endpoint should return a JSON object with a url field exactly. If the conversion service cannot parse the response or doesn’t find a URL, the image won’t be inserted.
- **Security:** Tiptap doesn’t restrict what endpoint you use. You can include tokens or keys in the URL (e.g., https://your-server.com/upload-image?key=123) to control access. The conversion service will simply call that URL. Implement any necessary auth on your side (for instance, verifying a secret token in the request headers or URL).
- **Persistence of images:** The URLs you return will be used in your editor’s content going forward. For example, after import, your editor will have image nodes with src: "https://my-cdn.com/uploads/unique-image-name.png". Anyone who later exports or views that content will attempt to load that URL. Make sure the images remain available at those URLs (don’t delete them immediately)​

### Server implementation example
This example shows a simple server implementation that accepts image uploads & uploads them to an S3 bucket configured by environment variables.

```ts
 import { serve } from '@hono/node-server'
 import { Hono } from 'hono'
 import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage'
 import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3'

 const {
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
   AWS_REGION,
   AWS_S3_BUCKET,
   PORT = '3011',
   AWS_ENDPOINT,
   AWS_FORCE_STYLE,
 } = process.env

 if (!AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID || !AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY || !AWS_S3_BUCKET) {
   console.error('Please provide AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_S3_BUCKET')
   process.exit(1)
 }

 const s3 = new S3Client({
   credentials: {
     accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
     secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
   },

   region: AWS_REGION,
   endpoint: AWS_ENDPOINT,
   forcePathStyle: AWS_FORCE_STYLE === 'true',
 })

 const app = new Hono() as Hono<any>

 app.post('/upload', async (c) => {
   // if you are using v2 import, you need this
   const file = await c.req.blob()

   const filename = c.req.header('File-Name')
   const fileType = c.req.header('Content-Type')
   // end
   // if you are using v1 import, you need this
   const body = await c.req.parseBody()
   const file = body['file']

   const filename = file.name
   const fileType = file.type
   // end

   if (!file) {
     return c.json({ error: 'No file uploaded' }, 400)
   }

   try {
     const data = await new Upload({
       client: s3,
       params: {
         Bucket: AWS_S3_BUCKET,
         Key: filename,
         Body: file,
         ContentType: fileType,
       },
     }).done()

     return c.json({ url: data.Location })
   } catch (error) {
     console.error(error)
     return c.json({ error: 'Failed to upload file' }, 500)
   }
 })

 serve({
   fetch: app.fetch,
   port: Number(PORT) || 3000,
 })
```

Here is another implementation using bun with no dependencies:

```ts
 const s3Client = new Bun.S3Client({
   accessKeyId: process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
   secretAccessKey: process.env.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
   region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
   bucket: process.env.AWS_BUCKET,
   endpoint: process.env.AWS_ENDPOINT,
 })

 Bun.serve({
   port: 8081,
   async fetch(req) {
     const url = new URL(req.url)

     // Handle file uploads on the /upload endpoint
     if (url.pathname === '/upload') {

       // if you are using v2 import, you need this
       const file = await req.blob()

       const filename = req.headers.get('File-Name')!
       const fileType = req.headers.get('Content-Type')!
       // end
       // if you are using v1 import, you need this
       const body = await req.formData()
       const file = body.get('file')

       const filename = file.name
       const fileType = file.type
       // end

       const file = await req.blob()

       if (!file) {
         return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'No file uploaded' }), {
           status: 400,
           headers: {
             'content-type': 'application/json',
           },
         })
       }

       try {
         // The file already has a name and type, so we can use it directly
         const s3File = s3Client.file(filename, { type: fileType })
         // Write the file to S3
         await s3File.write(file)

         return new Response(
           JSON.stringify({
             // Send the URL of the uploaded file back to the client to insert it into the editor
             url: new Response(s3File).headers.get('location'),
           }),
           {
             headers: {
               'content-type': 'application/json',
             },
           },
         )
       } catch (error) {
         return new Response(
           JSON.stringify({
             error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to upload file',
           }),
           {
             status: 500,
             headers: {
               'content-type': 'application/json',
             },
           },
         )
       }
     }

     return new Response(JSON.stringify({ error: 'Not found' }), {
       status: 404,
     })
   },
 })
```
