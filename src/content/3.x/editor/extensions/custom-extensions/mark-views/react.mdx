Using Vanilla JavaScript can feel complex if you are used to work in React. Good news: You can use regular React components in your mark views, too. There is just a little bit you need to know, but let’s go through this one by one.

## Render a React component

Here is what you need to do to render React components inside your editor:

1. [Create a node extension](/editor/extensions/custom-extensions)
2. Create a React component
3. Pass that component to the provided `ReactNodeViewRenderer`
4. Register it with `addNodeView()`
5. [Configure Tiptap to use your new node extension](/editor/getting-started/configure)

This is how your node extension could look like:

```ts
import { Mark } from '@tiptap/core'
import { ReactMarkViewRenderer } from '@tiptap/react'

import Component from './Component.jsx'

export default Mark.create({
  // options…

  addMarkView() {
    return ReactMarkViewRenderer(Component)
  },
})
```

And here is an example of a React component:

```tsx
import { MarkViewContent, MarkViewRendererProps } from '@tiptap/react'
import React from 'react'

export default (props: MarkViewRendererProps) => {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)

  return (
    <span className="content" data-test-id="mark-view">
      <MarkViewContent />
      <label contentEditable={false}>
        React component:
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setCount(count + 1)
          }}
        >
          This button has been clicked {count} times.
        </button>
      </label>
    </span>
  )
}
```

Got it? Let’s see it in action. Feel free to copy the below example to get started.
