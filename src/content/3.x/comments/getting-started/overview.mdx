The `Comments` extension lets users create threads and comments in the editor. Threads can be used to discuss specific parts of the document, while individual comments can be added to particular sections.

Comments can be accessed and manipulated through the [Comments REST API](/3.x/comments/integrate/rest-api) or received via [webhooks](/3.x/comments/integrate/webhook), enabling the creation of notification systems and the ability to add comments from outside the Editor.

<Callout title="Subscription required" variant="warning">
  This extension requires a valid Entry, Business or Enterprise subscription and a running [Tiptap
  Cloud instance](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/). To install the extension, you need [access to our
  private registry](/3.x/guides/pro-extensions). Set this up before proceeding.
