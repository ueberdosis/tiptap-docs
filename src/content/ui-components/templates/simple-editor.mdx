The Tiptap Simple Editor Template is a fully working **Open Source** editor setup featuring the Tiptap editor, extensions, and UI components.

By using the template, you get a complete editor implementation that you can run immediately and then customize as needed.

The Simple Editor template includes open source extensions such as Bold, Italic, Bullet List, etc., along with corresponding UI components (like MarkButton, ListButton, etc.) in a simple toolbar layout. The UI components are all optimized for desktop, tablet and mobile!

## Install

Copy and paste the following code into your project

```bash
npx tiptap-cli add simple
```

After running the CLI command, you’ll have a ready-made editor component that you can import into your app. From there, you can customize the editor’s configuration (enable/disable extensions) or tweak the UI as desired.
