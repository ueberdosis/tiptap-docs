Tiptap Primitives are small UI components designed to help you build custom editor interfaces.

They’re perfect for quickly assembling toolbars, popovers, dropdowns, and other interactive elements to complement your Tiptap editor.

## Installation

You can install each primitive individually using the Tiptap CLI:

```bash
npx tiptap-cli add <component-name>
```

## Customization & Theming
By default, these primitives apply only minimal or no styling. You can wrap them in your own class names, style them with your favorite CSS framework, or integrate them into a larger design system.

The goal is to keep them flexible and composable, so you can build what your editor needs.
