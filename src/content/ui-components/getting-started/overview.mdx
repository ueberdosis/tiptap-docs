Tiptap’s UI Components are pre-built React components that add ready-made controls and interactive elements to your editor. They cover common rich-text editor features, from inserting links or images to toggling formatting, so you don’t have to build these controls from scratch.

Each UI component typically corresponds to a Tiptap extension or feature (for example, the Comment Button works with the Comments extension, the Text Align Button works with the TextAlign extension, etc.).

Mix and match these components in your interface to create custom toolbars, menus, popovers, and more.

Using these components ensures consistent behavior and speeds up development. They are designed to work with @tiptap/react and Tiptap’s extensions. You can install only the components you need via the CLI, keeping your bundle lean.

Tiptap UI components are perfect for quickly assembling an editor UI with minimal effort, while still allowing customization of styling or behavior as needed.

## Install
You can install each UI component individually using the Tiptap CLI:

``` bash
npx tiptap-cli add <component-name>
```

For example, to add the Link Popover component to your project:

``` bash
npx tiptap-cli add link-popover
```

After running the command, import and use the component in your React application as shown in the usage examples on each component’s page.

    Remember to include any required Tiptap extension in your editor configuration (e.g. add the Link extension when using the LinkPopover).
