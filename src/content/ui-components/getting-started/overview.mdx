Tiptap is a headless, modular editor, giving you full control over how you structure and style its UI. The **Tiptap UI Components** library offers optional, prebuilt interfaces to save time without sacrificing flexibility.

## Source code

Access to Tiptap UI Components depends on the license of the Tiptap extension they’re built on. Components for open source extensions are also open source (MIT licensed), while those for paid Tiptap Cloud features (e.g., Comments, Content AI, etc.) require a valid Tiptap subscription or trial.

In any case, once you integrated a UI component the source code is available for inspection and customization:

- Read through the implementation and understand how each feature works.
- Modify or extend components directly in your project, rather than overriding them with complicated CSS.
- Adapt them to fit edge cases or advanced scenarios that a generic UI might not cover.

<Callout title="Tiptap Cloud Features" variant="hint">
    For paid Tiptap Cloud features, we’re in the process of developing dedicated UI components. These will only work if you have a valid Tiptap subscription or trial.
</Callout>

To use a Tiptap UI component for a specific extension (open source or paid), you must include the corresponding Tiptap extension in your editor. If you install a **Heading Dropdown Menu** component, for example, be sure to add the **Heading** extension to your editor configuration.

## Design defaults
By default, our components are intended to feel vanilla and blend into your own design. They come with styling and primary colors that can be easily overridden.

The design is consistent and cohesive across all components, so if you use multiple of them together, they’ll match nicely without extra work.

- Plug them into your React application with minimal styling if you just need something working right away.
- Or fully customize colors, spacing, and behavior to match your brand identity.

Since the code is open, you can tweak anything you want without having to `!important` override.

## Components and Primitives
To build a great editing experience in your Tiptap editor, you can integrate our UI elements. Our library provides two main types of building blocks for this: **UI Components** and **Primitives**.

### UI Components

These are ready-made, feature-specific React components like a heading dropdown for example. Each UI Component typically pairs with a Tiptap extension (e.g., the **ListButton** relies on list-related extensions), and uses React hooks to interact with the editor’s state.

- **Works with extensions**: To use a component (e.g., `HeadingDropdownMenu`), ensure the matching Tiptap extension (like `@tiptap/extension-heading`) is enabled in your editor.
- **Leverages hooks**: Many components internally consume hooks (like `useTiptapEditor` or `useFloatingElement`) to synchronize with editor state, handle positioning, or manage keyboard navigation. You can also use these hooks in your own custom components.
- **Easy customization**: By default, these components have minimal styling so they can blend into your design. You can fully override or extend them. Each component’s source code is openly available for direct edits with no `!important` hacks.

### Primitives

Primitives are low-level, unstyled UI elements (e.g., `Button`, `DropdownMenu`, `Popover`, `Spacer`). They’re the foundation behind many of our UI Components, handling accessibility and basic behaviors. You can mix and match these primitives to create your own bespoke editor controls or to further customize existing components.

## Next steps

Now that you’ve got an overview of Tiptap UI Components, you can:

- **Use the Simple Editor Template**
Get a fully working editor with common open source features in place. Great for quickly spinning up a basic rich text editor.

- **Install individual UI Components**
Pick and choose only the functionality you need if you already have a Tiptap setup or want a more modular approach.
[Browse the full list of UI Components →](/ui-components/components)

- **Set up the CLI**
Use the Tiptap CLI to install templates or individual components automatically.
