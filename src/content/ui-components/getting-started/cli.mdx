The Tiptap CLI is a tool for quickly scaffolding editors, installing UI components or primitives, and configuring Tiptap in your project. It removes much of the manual work so you can start building editor features faster.

## Overview

The CLI helps you:
- **Initialize** a new Tiptap project (`tiptap-cli init`)
- **Add** specific UI components or extensions (`tiptap-cli add <component-name>`)

## Requirements

- **Node.js** (LTS or Current recommended)
- **Package manager** of your choice (pnpm, npm, or yarn)
- **Existing React or Next.js project** (the CLI can also initialize new projects if desired)

> **Tip:** If you want to install the CLI locally as a dev dependency, you can. However, we recommend using `npx` to avoid a global installation.


## Installation

You can run the CLI directly with npx:

```bash
npx tiptap-cli <command>
```

Or install it globally if you prefer (optional):

```bash
npm install -g tiptap-cli
```

Then you can invoke it anywhere using:

```bash
tiptap-cli <command>
```
