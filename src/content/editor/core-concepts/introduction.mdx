## Structure

ProseMirror works with a strict [Schema](/editor/core-concepts/schema), which defines the allowed structure of a document. A document is a tree of headings, paragraphs and other elements, called nodes. Marks can be attached to a node, e. g. to emphasize part of it. [Commands](/editor/api/commands) change that document programmatically.

## State

The document is stored in a state. Changes are applied as transactions to the state. The state has details about the current content, cursor position and selection. You can hook into [events](/editor/api/events), for example to alter transactions before they get applied.

## Content

The document is stored internally as a [ProseMirror node](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node), and can be retrieved as a Tiptap JSON object calling `editor.getJSON()`.

Tiptap JSON is the recommended format for storing the document and working with it. Below is an example Tiptap JSON document:

```json
{
  "type": "doc",
  "content": [
  {
   "type": "paragraph",
   "attrs": {
    "textAlign": "center"
   },
   "content": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Hello, " },
    {
     "type": "text",
     "text": "world",
     "marks": [{ "type": "bold" }, { "type": "italic" }]
    },
    { "type": "text", "text": "!" }
   ]
  }
  ]
}
```

A Tiptap JSON document is a tree of nodes. Some nodes can have children, but only text nodes (those with `type: 'text'`) can contain text. Text nodes and other inline nodes can have marks applied to them. Some nodes and marks can have attributes.

## Extensions

Extensions add [nodes](/editor/extensions/nodes), [marks](/editor/extensions/marks) and/or [functionalities](/editor/extensions/functionality) to the editor. A lot of those extensions bound their commands to common [keyboard shortcuts](/editor/core-concepts/keyboard-shortcuts).

## Vocabulary

ProseMirror has its own vocabulary and you’ll stumble upon all those words now and then. Here is a short overview of the most common words we use in the documentation.

| Word        | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Schema      | Configures the structure your content can have.                          |
| Document    | The actual content in your editor.                                       |
| State       | Everything to describe the current content and selection of your editor. |
| Transaction | A change to the state (updated selection, content, …)                    |
| Extension   | Registers new functionality.                                             |
| Node        | A type of content, for example a heading or a paragraph.                 |
| Mark        | Can be applied to nodes, for example for inline formatting.              |
| Command     | Execute an action inside the editor, that somehow changes the state.     |
| Decoration  | Styling on top of the document, for example to highlight mistakes.       |
