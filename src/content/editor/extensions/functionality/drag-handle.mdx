Have you ever wanted to drag nodes around your editor? Well, we did too—so here’s an extension for that.

The `DragHandle` extension allows you to easily handle dragging nodes around in the editor. You can define custom render functions, placement, and more.

<CodeDemo isPro path="/Extensions/DragHandle" />

## Install

<Callout title="Set up access to Tiptap's private repository" variant="info">
  Integrate this pro extension by registering for a free [Tiptap
  account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/register) and following our [access
  guide](/guides/pro-extensions) to Tiptap’s private repository.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-drag-handle
```

## Settings

### render

Renders an element that is positioned with tippy.js. This is the element that will be displayed as the handle when dragging a node around.

```js
DragHandle.configure({
  render: () => {
    const element = document.createElement('div')

    // Use as a hook for CSS to insert an icon
    element.classList.add('custom-drag-handle')

    return element
  },
})
```

### tippyOptions

Options for tippy.js. You can pass any options that are available in the [tippy.js documentation](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/all-props/).

Default: `undefined`

```js
DragHandle.configure({
  tippyOptions: {
    placement: 'left',
  },
})
```

### onNodeChange

Returns a node or null when a node is hovered over. This can be used to highlight the node that is currently hovered over.

Default: `undefined`

```js
DragHandle.configure({
  onNodeChange: ({ node, editor, pos }) => {
    if (!node) {
      selectedNode = null
      return
    }
    // Do something with the node
    selectedNode = node
  },
})
```

## Commands

### lockDragHandle()

Locks the draghandle in place and visibility. If the drag handle was visible, it will remain visible until unlocked. If it was hidden, it will remain hidden until unlocked.

This can be useful if you want to have a menu inside of the drag handle and want it to remain visible whether the drag handle is moused over or not.

```js
editor.commands.lockDragHandle()
```

### unlockDragHandle()

Unlocks the draghandle. Resets to default visibility and behavior.

```js
editor.commands.unlockDragHandle()
```

### toggleDragHandle()

Toggle draghandle lock state. If the drag handle is locked, it will be unlocked and vice versa.

```js
editor.commands.toggleDragHandle()
```
