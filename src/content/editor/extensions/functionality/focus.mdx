The Focus extension adds a CSS class to focused nodes. By default it adds `.has-focus`, but you can change that.

Note that itâ€™s only a class, the styling is totally up to you. The usage example below has some CSS for that class.

<CodeDemo path="/Extensions/Focus" />

## Install

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-focus
```

## Settings

### className

The class that is applied to the focused element.

Default: `'has-focus'`

```js
FocusClasses.configure({
  className: 'focus',
})
```

### mode

Apply the class to `'all'`, the `'shallowest'` or the `'deepest'` node.

Default: `'all'`

```js
FocusClasses.configure({
  mode: 'deepest',
})
```
