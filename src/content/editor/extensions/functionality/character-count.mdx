import { CodeDemo } from '@/components/CodeDemo'

The `CharacterCount` extension limits the number of allowed characters to a specific length and is able to return the number of characters and words. That’s it, that’s all.

<CodeDemo path="/Extensions/CharacterCount" />

## Install

```bash
npm install @tiptap/extension-character-count
```

## Settings

### limit

The maximum number of characters that should be allowed.

Default: `null`

```js
CharacterCount.configure({
  limit: 240,
})
```

### mode

The mode by which the size is calculated.

Default: `'textSize'`

```js
CharacterCount.configure({
  mode: 'nodeSize',
})
```

## Storage

### characters()

Get the number of characters for the current document.

```js
editor.storage.characterCount.characters()

// Get the size of a specific node.
editor.storage.characterCount.characters({ node: someCustomNode })

// Overwrite the default `mode`.
editor.storage.characterCount.characters({ mode: 'nodeSize' })
```

### words()

Get the number of words for the current document.

```js
editor.storage.characterCount.words()
