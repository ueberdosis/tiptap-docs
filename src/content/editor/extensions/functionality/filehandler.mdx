Have you ever wanted to drag and drop or paste files into your editor? Well, we did too—so here’s an extension for that.

The `FileHandler` extension allows you to easily handle file drops and pastes in the editor. You can define custom handlers for both events & manage allowed file types.

<Callout title="No Image Display Functionality" variant="info">
    This extension is only responsible for handling files in your editor. It doesn’t display them,
    for that you can integrate the [image
    extension](/editor/extensions/nodes/image)
</Callout>

<CodeDemo isPro path="/Extensions/FileHandler" />

## Install

<Callout title="Set up access to Tiptap's private repository" variant="info">
  Integrate this pro extension by registering for a free [Tiptap
  account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/register) and following our [access
  guide](/guides/pro-extensions) to Tiptap’s private repository.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-file-handler
```

## Settings

### onPaste

The callback function that will be called when a file is pasted into the editor. You will have access to the editor instance & the files pasted.

Default: `undefined`

```js
FileHandler.configure({
  onPaste: (editor, files, htmlContent) => {
    // do something with the files
    // and insert the file into the editor
    // in some cases (for example copy / pasted gifs from other apps) you should probably not use the file directly
    // as the file parser will only have a single gif frame as png
    // in this case, you can extract the url from the htmlContent and use it instead, let other inputRules handle insertion
    // or do anything else with the htmlContent pasted into here
  },
})
```

### onDrop

The callback function that will be called when a file is dropped into the editor. You will have access to the editor instance, the files dropped and the position the file was dropped at.

Default: `undefined`

```js
FileHandler.configure({
  onDrop: (editor, files, pos) => {
    // do something with the files
    // and insert the file into the editor
  },
})
```

### allowedMimeTypes

This option controls which file types are allowed to be dropped or pasted into the editor. You can define a list of mime types or a list of file extensions. If no mime types or file extensions are defined, all files will be allowed.

Default: `undefined`

```js
FileHandler.configure({
  allowedMimeTypes: ['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif'],
})
```
