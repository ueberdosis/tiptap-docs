You ever wanted to drag nodes around your react-based editor? Well we too - so here is an extension for that.

The `DragHandleReact` component allows you to easily handle dragging nodes around in the editor. You can define custom render functions, placement, and more.
It essentially wraps the [DragHandle](/editor/extensions/functionality/drag-handle) extension in a React component that will automatically register/unregister the extension with the editor.

<CodeDemo isPro path="/Experiments/DragHandleReact" />

## Install

<Callout title="Set up access to Tiptap's private repository" variant="info">
  Integrate this pro extension by registering for a free [Tiptap
  account](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/register) and following our [access
  guide](/guides/pro-extensions) to Tiptapâ€™s private repository.
</Callout>

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-drag-handle-react
```

## Props

All props follow the same structure as the [DragHandle](/editor/extensions/functionality/drag-handle) extension.

### children

The content that should be displayed inside of the drag handle.

```jsx
<DragHandle>
  <div>Drag Me!</div>
</DragHandle>
```

### tippyOptions

Options for tippy.js. You can pass any options that are available in the [tippy.js documentation](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs/v6/all-props/).

Default: `undefined`

```jsx
<DragHandle
  tippyOptions={{
    placement: 'left',
  }}
>
  <div>Drag Me!</div>
</DragHandle>
```

### onNodeChange

Returns a node or null when a node is hovered over. This can be used to highlight the node that is currently hovered over.

Default: `undefined`

```jsx
function Component() {
  const [selectedNode, setSelectedNode] = useState(null)

  return (
    <DragHandle
      onNodeChange={({ node, editor }) => {
        setSelectedNode(node)
        // do something with the node
      }}
    >
      <div>Drag Me!</div>
    </DragHandle>
  )
}
```

### pluginKey

The key that should be used to store the plugin in the editor. This is useful if you have multiple drag handles in the same editor.

Default: `undefined`

```jsx
<DragHandle pluginKey="myCustomDragHandle">
  <div>Drag Me!</div>
</DragHandle>
```

### Commands

See the [DragHandle](/editor/extensions/functionality/drag-handle) extension for available editor commands.
