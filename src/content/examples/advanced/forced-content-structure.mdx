Does your editor require content in a specific structure? You can enforce specific content structures via **custom documents** that extend our default `@tiptap/extension-document` extension. See below to learn more about how to create a custom document schema.

<CodeDemo path="/Examples/CustomDocument" />

> **Note**: If you use the Trailing Node extension in combination with a custom document structure, adjust the `node` option manually - otherwise ProseMirror will fall back to the default node from your schema. For example, in the heading + block demo a heading node might be assumed as the default trailing node. See the [Trailing Node docs](/editor/extensions/functionality/trailing-node) for more details.
