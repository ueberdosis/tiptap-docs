With the `context` option, you can provide additional information to the AI model to help it generate more relevant content. This can be useful when you want to generate content that is more aligned with the context of the conversation.

## Context option

Context can be provided in two formats, `text` and `url`. The `text` format is used to provide additional text context to the AI model, while the `url` format is used to provide a URL context.

<Callout title="URL requirements" variant="warning">
    The url provided must be a valid URL that is accessible by Tiptap Content AI. This is useful when
    you want to provide additional context to the AI model that is referencing a third-party source.
