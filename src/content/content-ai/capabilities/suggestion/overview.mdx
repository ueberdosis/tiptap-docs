The AI Suggestion extension analyzes the document and shows suggestions that users can accept and reject. It works out-of-the-box with Content AI Cloud, and can be easily extended to work with your own backend and LLMs.

## Features

- [Define your own rules](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/features/define-rules) to enforce your style guide, improve readability, and ensure that your users' content follows best practices.
- [Apply suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/features/apply-suggestions): Replace words, phrases, or sentences with suggestions generated by the AI Suggestion extension.
- Rich text support in suggestions, so you can enforce style rules like formatting keywords in bold or italic.
- [Integrate your own backend and LLMs](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/custom-llms)
- [Customize the user interface](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/features/display-suggestions): Full control over how suggestions are displayed on the editor.

## How It Works

The AI Suggestion extension uses Tiptap Cloud's OpenAI models (or your custom backend) to generate proofreading suggestions from your rules and the editor's content. The extension covers both the client and server-side implementations. Here is the user experience:

1. When the editor loads, the AI Suggestion extension generates suggestions based on its initial content and rules.
2. If the user edits the rules or content, the extension's suggestions are updated in real-time.
3. The user can review and accept suggestions, or reject them.
4. When a suggestion is accepted, the editor's content is updated with the new text.
