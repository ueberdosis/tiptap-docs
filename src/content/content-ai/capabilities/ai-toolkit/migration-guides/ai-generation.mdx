The AI Generation extension allows you to select content and ask AI model to re-write it based on your instructions.

To implement the same functionality with the AI Toolkit, the recommend path is to follow the [inline edits guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/guides/inline-edits).

## Step 1: Server-side setup

The AI Generation extension works out of the box with [Tiptap Cloud](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/cloud/ai).

The AI Toolkit does not include a Tiptap Cloud service. Instead, it works with your custom AI backend. This gives you full flexibility to use it with any AI model provider and framework.

First, build an API endpoint that returns the AI-generated content in HTML format. Use a library like the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/) to call your backend.

```ts
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { streamText } from 'ai'

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { userRequest, selection } = await req.json()

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-5-mini'),
    system: `You are an expert writer that can edit rich text documents.
The user has selected part of the document. You will receive the current
content of the selection (in HTML format) and the user's request. Re-write
the content of the selection to meet the user's request. Generate the HTML
code for the new content of the selection. If the user's request is not 
clear or does not relate to editing the document, generate HTML code where
you ask the user to clarify the request. Your response should only contain
the HTML code, no other text or explanation, no Markdown, and your HTML 
response should not be wrapped in backticks, Markdown code blocks, or other
extra formatting.`,
    prompt: `User request:
"""
${userRequest}
"""
Selection:
"""
${selection}
"""`,
  })

  // Return the text stream directly
  return result.toTextStreamResponse()
}
```

To access the OpenAI API, create an API key in the [OpenAI Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it as an environment variable. The environment variable will be detected automatically by the Vercel AI SDK.

```sh
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

## Step 2: Client-side setup

In the client-side code, first call the API endpoint you just defined so that the AI generates the content. That endpoint returns a stream of HTML content. Use the `streamHtml` method of the AI Toolkit to stream the content into the editor.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

// Use the AI Toolkit to get the selection in HTML format
const selection = toolkit.getHtmlSelection()

// Call the API endpoint to get the edited HTML content
const response = await fetch('/api', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userRequest: 'Add emojis to this text',
    selection,
  }),
})

// The response is a stream of HTML content
const readableStream = response.body

// Use the AI Toolkit to stream HTML into the selection
await toolkit.streamHtml(readableStream, { position: 'selection' })
```

## Review AI-generated changes

To show a preview of the AI-generated content where the user can review and accept or reject the changes, use the `streamHtml` method with the `reviewOptions` parameter.

```ts
await toolkit.streamHtml(readableStream, {
  position: 'selection',
  // Show a preview of the content where the user can review and accept or reject the changes
  reviewOptions: { mode: 'preview' },
})
```

Learn more about review options in the [review changes guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/guides/review-changes) and in the [API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/edit-the-document#streamhtml) of the `streamHtml` method.

## Implement autocompletion

To implement autocompletion, call the API endpoint to generate content when the user presses the `Tab` key. Then, insert the content using the `streamHtml` method. The `position` parameter can also be set to `'selection'` because it coincides with the position of the cursor.

Below is a simplified snippet of the code that triggers the autocompletion suggestion when the user presses the `Tab` key.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)
const cursorPosition = editor.state.selection.to

const contentBefore = toolkit.getHtmlRange({ from: 0, to: cursorPosition })
const response = await fetch('/api', {
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userRequest: 'Autocomplete the previous text',
    selection: contentBefore,
  }),
})

const readableStream = response.body

await toolkit.streamHtml(readableStream, {
  position: 'selection',
})
```

Optionally, you can preview the AI-generated content before inserting it into the editor, instead of inserting it immediately.

```ts
await toolkit.streamHtml(readableStream, {
  position: 'selection',
  reviewOptions: { mode: 'preview' },
})
```

Once generated, the suggestion can be accepted by calling the `acceptSuggestion` method.

```ts
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()
await toolkit.acceptSuggestion(suggestions[0].id)
```
