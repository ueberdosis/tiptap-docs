The AI Changes extension allows you to compare two documents in real time and display the changes as a set of changes that users can accept or reject.

You can achieve the same result with the "Compare documents" functionality of the AI Toolkit.

To integrate it in your app, follow the [Compare documents guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/compare-documents).
