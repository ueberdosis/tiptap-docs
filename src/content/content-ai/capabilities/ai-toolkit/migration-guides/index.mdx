All other Tiptap AI extensions can be completely replaced with the AI Toolkit.

Compared to other AI extensions, the AI Toolkit gives you more flexibility and control. Migrating to the AI Toolkit is recommended as you scale your application, to allow for more bespoke AI functionality. Its API integrates with any AI model provider and AI agent framework.

We offer migration guides for the following extensions:

- [AI Generation](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/migration-guides/ai-generation)
- [AI Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/migration-guides/ai-suggestion)
- [AI Changes](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/migration-guides/ai-changes)
- [AI Assistant](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/migration-guides/ai-assistant)

Each guide will help you migrate your existing AI functionality to the AI Toolkit.
