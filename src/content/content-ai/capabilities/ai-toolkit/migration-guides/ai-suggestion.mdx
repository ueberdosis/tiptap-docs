The AI Suggestion extension lets you AI review the document and display suggestions that users can accept or reject.

You can achieve the same functionality with the AI Toolkit by following the [Proofreader guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/proofreader).

## Reviewing the document

In the [Proofreader guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/proofreader), the `setHtmlSuggestions` method is used to display a list of suggestions that users can accept or reject, from HTML content that was generated by an AI model.

It's recommended to have a look at the [API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions#sethtmlsuggestions) of the `setHtmlSuggestions` method to learn more about its parameters and customizaton options.

## Accepting and rejecting suggestions

To learn more about how suggestions are stored and managed, have a look at the [API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions) of the suggestions utilities.

In particular, use the `applySuggestion` method to apply a specific suggestion to the document.

## Customizing the appearance of the suggestions

The appearance of the suggestions can be completely customized with the AI Toolkit's options. [See API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions#styling-suggestions).

You can also render React and Vue components inside a suggestion, using the `renderDecorations` option. [See API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions#render-react-components-inside-a-suggestion). This option can be configured to render a popover or a tooltip when a suggestion is selected.

## Improving speed and performance

The AI Toolkit's suggestions utility is significantly faster than the AI Suggestion extension, because it lets you stream suggestions (see the [Proofreader guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/proofreader) for an example). This is a major improvement over the AI Suggestion extension, where suggestions were loaded all at once, which could cause performance issues when there were a lot of suggestions.

The AI Toolkit also provides a way to split the document into chunks. Then, each of these chunks can be sent to the AI and processed independently. Parallelizing the processing of the chunks can significantly improve latency.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

// Split the document into chunks of the default size
const chunks = toolkit.getHtmlChunks()

// For each chunk, call the AI to generate the changes,
// and set the suggestions using the `setHtmlSuggestions` method,
// only on the range of that chunk.
toolkit.setHtmlSuggestions({
  range: chunk.range,
  changes: [{ delete: 'TipTap', insert: 'Tiptap' }],
})
```
