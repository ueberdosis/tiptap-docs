# @tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-langchain

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

### Major Changes

- Add new `editThreads` and `getThreads` tools for AI-powered comment and thread management
- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.26`

## 3.0.0-alpha.7

### Major Changes

- Rename `applyDiff` tool to `applyPatch`
- Improve format and tool definition of the `applyDiff` tool (now called `applyPatch`) so that the AI generates a list of patch operations. This improves accuracy (because the AI is not tempted to do unnecessary jumps) and reduces token usage significantly

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

### Minor Changes

- Add `activeNodeRange` position to the `insertContent` tool to allow the AI to insert content at the active node range. This improves the accuracy of the edits when the `applyDiff` tool is disabled.

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- Experimental implementation of the AI Toolkit + Pages extension integration. Introduces the `readPage` tool.

## 3.0.0-alpha.4

### Major changes

- Improve tool definitions of `readSelection` and `insertContent` tools to fix a bug where the AI inserts the content in the wrong place if the user changes the selection after the AI reads the selection. Requires a version of the AI Toolkit equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha-17`

## 3.0.0-alpha.3

### Major Changes

- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.14`
- Improved tool definitions for reading and editing the document

## 3.0.0-alpha.2

### Minor Changes

- Improve `readFirstChunk` tool description

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes

- Initial release with LangChain.js tool definitions for Tiptap AI Toolkit
