# @tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-openai

## 3.0.0-alpha.14

### Minor Changes

- Add `tiptapEdit`, `tiptapRead`, and `tiptapReadSelection` tools that make edits faster and more efficient. These tools are experimental and opt-in.

## 3.0.0-alpha.13

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug that caused the AI to not read the document at the beginning of the chat interaction.

## 3.0.0-alpha.12

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug that caused the AI to read the entire document when it was not necessary to do so.

## 3.0.0-alpha.11

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug that caused the AI to read the incorrect content of the document after updating the document.

## 3.0.0-alpha.10

### Patch Changes

- Fix bug where new threads and comments were not created in the right position of the document.

## 3.0.0-alpha.9

### Major Changes

- New format for the tool input of the `applyPatch` tool. This format makes the tool definitions simpler and more consistent.
- Improved tool output and tool definitions of all the built-in tools.
- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.37`

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

### Major Changes

- Makes the insertContent tool independent of the format of the content, by renaming the "html" property to "content".
- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.36`

### Patch Changes

- Fixes bug in insertContent tool where the activeNodeRange is not a valid value for the position.
- Fixes bug where the insertContent tool would cause the activeNodeRange to always reset to 0.

## 3.0.0-alpha.7

### Major Changes

- Add new `editThreads` and `getThreads` tools for AI-powered comment and thread management
- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.26`

## 3.0.0-alpha.6

### Major Changes

- Rename `applyDiff` tool to `applyPatch`
- Improve format and tool definition of the `applyDiff` tool (now called `applyPatch`) so that the AI generates a list of patch operations. This improves accuracy (because the AI is not tempted to do unnecessary jumps) and reduces token usage significantly

## 3.0.0-alpha.5

### Minor Changes

- Add `activeNodeRange` position to the `insertContent` tool to allow the AI to insert content at the active node range. This improves the accuracy of the edits when the `applyDiff` tool is disabled.

## 3.0.0-alpha.4

### Minor Changes

- Experimental implementation of the AI Toolkit + Pages extension integration. Introduces the `readPage` tool.

## 3.0.0-alpha.3

### Major changes

- Improve tool definitions of `readSelection` and `insertContent` tools to fix a bug where the AI inserts the content in the wrong place if the user changes the selection after the AI reads the selection. Requires a version of the AI Toolkit equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha-17`

## 3.0.0-alpha.2

### Major Changes

- Requires upgrading to a version of the `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit` package that is equal or higher than `3.0.0-alpha.14`
- Improved tool definitions for reading and editing the document

## 3.0.0-alpha.1

### Major Changes
