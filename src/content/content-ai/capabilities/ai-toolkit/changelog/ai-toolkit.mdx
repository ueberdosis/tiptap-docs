# @tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit

## 3.0.0-alpha.25

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue (regression) in `applyPatch` tool where the last operation was not being parsed correctly when streaming. This caused the text to gradually disappear during streaming.

## 3.0.0-alpha.24

### Major Changes

- Rename `applyDiff` tool to `applyPatch`
- Rename `applyHtmlDiff` method to `applyHtmlPatch`.
- Improve format and tool definition of the `applyDiff` tool (now called `applyPatch`) so that the AI generates a list of patch operations. This improves accuracy (because the AI is not tempted to do unnecessary jumps) and reduces token usage significantly
- Requires upgrading to a version of these provider libraries that is equal or higher than:
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions@3.0.0-alpha.8`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-ai-sdk@3.0.0-alpha.11`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-langchain@3.0.0-alpha.7`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-openai@3.0.0-alpha.6`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-anthropic@3.0.0-alpha.3`

## 3.0.0-alpha.23

### Minor Changes

- Add `activeNodeRange` position to the `insertContent` tool to allow the AI to insert content at the active node range. This improves the accuracy of the edits when the `applyDiff` tool is disabled.
- Requires upgrading to a version of these provider libraries that is equal or higher than:
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions@3.0.0-alpha.7`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-ai-sdk@3.0.0-alpha.10`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-langchain@3.0.0-alpha.6`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-openai@3.0.0-alpha.5`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-anthropic@3.0.0-alpha.2`

## 3.0.0-alpha.22

### Minor Changes

- Add `addHtmlSchemaAwareness` method to the extension configuration to provide the schema awareness data of a custom Node or Mark extension.

## 3.0.0-alpha.21

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue where the detailed diff was shown during streaming, which caused the diff to constantly update. Now, the detailed diff is only shown when the streaming is finished.
- Fix issue that caused extra paragraphs to be inserted during streaming, at the beginning of the streamed content.

## 3.0.0-alpha.20

### Major Changes

- Rename `getSchemaAwareness` method to `getHtmlSchemaAwareness`
- Improve the prompt generated by the schema awareness methods to be more accurate for the AI models

## 3.0.0-alpha.19

### Minor Changes

- Experimental implementation of the AI Toolkit + Pages extension integration. Introduces the `readPage` tool.

## 3.0.0-alpha.18

### Patch Changes

- Make `streamHtml` and `streamText` methods return a promise that resolves when the stream is finished

## 3.0.0-alpha.17

### Major Changes

- Improve tool definitions of `readSelection` and `insertContent` tools to fix a bug where the AI inserts the content in the wrong place if the user changes the selection after the AI reads the selection.

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue in `streamHtml` and `streamText` methods where a `ReadableStream` was not accepted as a parameter

## 3.0.0-alpha.16

### Major Changes

- Renamed `detailedDiff` to `diffMode` in review options to control how to display the difference between the original and the modified content

## 3.0.0-alpha.15

### Major Changes

- Add `detailedDiff` option to review options to control whether to display the change as a detailed diff. Rename `showDiff` option to `detailedDiff` for clarity
- Add `detailedDiff` option to tool execution and streaming options to control whether to display the change as a detailed diff, and set it to `true` by default so that the changes are displayed as a detailed diff by default

## 3.0.0-alpha.14

### Major Changes

- Requires upgrading to a version of these provider libraries that is equal or higher than:
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions@3.0.0-alpha.4`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-ai-sdk@3.0.0-alpha.7`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-langchain@3.0.0-alpha.3`
  - `@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-openai@3.0.0-alpha.2`
- Remove `currentChunk` parameter and return value from the `executeTool` method
  - The `executeTool` method no longer accepts `currentChunk` parameter
  - The `executeTool` method no longer returns `currentChunk` field
- Add `getActiveNodeRange` method to get the active node range. The active node range is the range of top-level nodes that can be edited in the next tool call, it helps the AI make more precise edits when editing the document with the `applyDiff` tool. It replaces the `currentChunk` parameter.
- Add `setActiveNodeRange` method to set the active node range
- Remove tools `readFirstChunk`, `readNextChunk` and `readPreviousChunk`.
- Add `readNodeRange` tool. This tool allows the AI to read any range of top-level nodes in the document. It is much more flexible than the previous chunk-based reading tools.

### Minor Changes

- Add `streamTool` method to stream a tool call into the editor

## 3.0.0-alpha.13

### Minor Changes

- Fix issue in suggestions diff view where extra elements like paragraphs were displayed in the suggestion diff content

## 3.0.0-alpha.12

## 3.0.0-alpha.9

### Major Changes

- Add `rejectAllChanges` method to reject all changes when comparing documents in real-time

## 3.0.0-alpha.8

### Major Changes

- Add `acceptChange` and `rejectChange` methods to accept and reject changes when comparing documents in real-time
- Remove `applySuggestionToOtherDoc` method because it's equivalent to `acceptChange` but with a more confusing name

- Improve accuracy of `getHtmlRange`, `getJsonRange`, and `getTextRange` methods when returning the chunk index

- The `docChanged` option is now `true` when the tool call modifies the document
