The Tiptap AI Toolkit provides tool definitions for the most popular AI provider libraries, like the [AI SDK by Vercel](https://ai-sdk.dev/). If your AI provider is not supported, [reach out to the Tiptap team](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev) with your request.

Another option is to build your own adapter library. This can be useful if you've built your AI agent in another language (for example, Python) and you want to use the tool definitions from the Tiptap AI Toolkit.

Install the package with the tool definitions in a generic format.

```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions
```

Then, call `toolDefinitions` and log the result to understand their structure.

```ts
import { toolDefinitions } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit-tool-definitions'

console.log(JSON.stringify(toolDefinitions(), null, 2))
```

The `toolDefinitions` function returns a list of tool definitions. Each of them is an object with the following properties:

- `name`: The name of the tool. This is its unique identifier.
- `description`: The description of the tool. This text describes the tool to the AI model.
- `inputSchema`: A [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) describing the input parameters of the tool

Use the printed data to build the tool definitions in your AI provider's format (e.g., Python backends).
