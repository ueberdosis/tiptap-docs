The Tiptap AI Toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Tiptap documents. These tools enable reading content, making edits, and navigating through large documents efficiently.

The tool definitions are available in the format of popular AI provider libraries:

- [AI SDK by Vercel](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/ai-sdk)
- [LangChain.js](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/langchain-js)
- [OpenAI](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/openai)
- [Anthropic](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/anthropic)
- [Mastra](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/mastra)
- [Other providers](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/other-providers)

When you add the tool definitions to your AI provider library, your AI agent will generate tool calls. You can then execute the tool calls using the [`executeTool` method](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/execute-tool).

```ts
// Read the document from the beginning
await agent.executeTool({
  toolName: 'tiptapRead',
  input: {
    from: 0,
  },
})
```
