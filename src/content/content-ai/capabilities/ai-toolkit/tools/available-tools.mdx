The Tiptap AI Toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Tiptap documents. These tools enable reading content, making edits, and navigating through large documents efficiently.

The tool definitions are available in the format of popular AI provider libraries:

- [AI SDK by Vercel](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/ai-sdk)
- [LangChain.js](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/langchain-js)
- [OpenAI](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/openai)
- [Anthropic](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/anthropic)
- [Mastra](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/mastra)
- [Other providers](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/tools/other-providers)

When you add the tool definitions to your AI provider library, your AI agent will generate tool calls. You can then execute the tool calls using the [`executeTool` method](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/execute-tool).

```ts
// Read the document from the beginning
await agent.executeTool({
  toolName: 'tiptapRead',
  input: {
    from: 0,
  },
})
```

## `getThreads`

Retrieve all threads and comments in the document. This tool provides comprehensive information about existing discussions and feedback in the document.

### Parameters

No parameters required.

### Result

The data of all the threads and comments in the document, including their content and location.

## `editThreads`

Perform operations on threads and comments in the document. This tool enables comprehensive thread and comment management including creating, updating, and deleting threads and comments.

### Parameters

- `operations` (`array`): Array of operations to perform, each with a `type` field and operation-specific parameters.

### Result

A success message if the operations were successful, or an error message if they were not.

### Requirements

These tools require the Comments extension to be configured in the editor with a CommentsProvider. The tools are deactivated by default and need to be explicitly enabled.
