import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

Suggestions are used to display the changes that the AI agent has made to the document. Each suggestion contains the following data:

- The range of the document that has changed
- The new content that should be inserted at that range. This content can be in different formats, like HTML, JSON, or plain text. There can also be multiple replacement options for the same range, and the user can choose which one to use.

## The `Suggestion` object

A `Suggestion` represents a proposed change to a range of content in the editor, typically generated by an AI agent. It allows previewing, reviewing, and applying changes, and can include multiple replacement options.

### Properties

- `id` (`string`): A unique identifier for the suggestion.
- `range` (`Range`): The range of content in the editor that the suggestion applies to.
- `rangeInOtherDoc?` (`Range`): If this `Suggestion` was created by comparing this document with another, this property contains the range of the `Change` in the other document.
- `replacementOptions` (`ReplacementOption[]`): One or more possible replacements for the selected range. The user can choose which option to apply. Each `ReplacementOption` can be one of the following types:
  - **SliceReplacementOption** (`type: 'slice'`):
    - `id` (`string`): Unique identifier for this replacement option.
    - `type` (`'slice'`): Indicates this is a slice replacement.
    - `addSlice` (`Slice`): The ProseMirror `Slice` object to insert as the replacement content.
    - `metadata?` (`Record<string, any>`): Optional extra metadata for this replacement option (e.g., source, category).
  - **TextReplacementOption** (`type: 'text'`):
    - `id` (`string`): Unique identifier for this replacement option.
    - `type` (`'text'`): Indicates this is a text replacement.
    - `addText` (`string`): The plain text to insert as the replacement content.
    - `metadata?` (`Record<string, any>`): Optional extra metadata for this replacement option (e.g., source, category).
- `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions`): Optional display options to control how the suggestion is rendered in the editor UI.
  - `showAsDiff?` (`boolean`): Show alternative content as a diff widget. Default: `true`.
  - `diffPosition?` (`'before' | 'after'`): Where to display the diff relative to the suggestion. Default: `'before'`
  - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Attributes added to rendered elements
  - `diffAttributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra HTML attributes to be added to the diff decoration of the suggestion
  - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Custom rendering function. Defaults to a function renders the suggestion as a diff.
- `reviewMode?` (`'preview' | 'review'`): The review mode of the suggestion. `'preview'` indicates the suggestion is a preview of a change before applying (default). `'review'` indicates the suggestion reviews a change that has already been made, allowing the user to undo it by applying the suggestion. This field is automatically set based on `reviewOptions.mode` when suggestions are created.
- `metadata?` (`Record<string, any>`): Optional extra metadata for the suggestion. This can be used to store additional information such as the source, category, or any custom data. It is not used internally by the extension but can help customize UI rendering.

## Style suggestions

Learn more about how to customize the appearance of suggestions with the [Style suggestions guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/style-suggestions).

## `getSuggestions`

Returns all current suggestions.

### Returns (`Suggestion[]`)

- `Suggestion[]`: The list of active suggestions.

### Example

```ts
// Get all active suggestions
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()
```

## `getSelectedSuggestion`

Returns the currently selected suggestion.

A suggestion is considered "selected" when the cursor (`editor.state.selection.head`) is over it.

### Returns (`Suggestion | null`)

- `Suggestion | null`: The currently selected suggestion, or `null` if no suggestion is selected.

### Example

```ts
// Get the currently selected suggestion
const selectedSuggestion = toolkit.getSelectedSuggestion()
```

## `setSuggestions` / `addSuggestions`

Replace or append suggestions.

### Parameters

- `inputs` (`SuggestionsFormat[]`): A list of suggestions in one of the following formats:
  - `suggestions`: A list of direct suggestions
  - `compareDocuments`: Suggestions will be generated from comparing the current document with another document

If two generated suggestions have overlapping ranges, only the first suggestion in the list will be displayed. The second suggestion will be ignored. Suggestions cannot have overlapping ranges because of a limitation in ProseMirror's decoration rendering engine.

#### `suggestions` format

- `type` (`string`): `'suggestions'`
- `suggestions` (`Suggestion[]`): A list of direct suggestions

#### `compareDocuments` format

- `type` (`string`): `'compareDocuments'`
- `doc` (`Node`): The document to compare against
- `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Customize rendering
  - `showAsDiff?` (`boolean`): Show alternative content as a diff widget. Default: `true`.
  - `diffPosition?` (`'before' | 'after'`): Where to display the diff relative to the suggestion. Default: `'before'`
  - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Attributes added to rendered elements
  - `diffAttributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra HTML attributes to be added to the diff decoration of the suggestion
  - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Custom rendering function. Defaults to a function renders the suggestion as a diff.
- `metadata?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra metadata for the suggestions, that can be used to store additional information about them (e.g. their source or category). It is not used internally by the AI Toolkit extension but it may help developers customize how a suggestion is displayed in the UI.
- `diffUtilityConfig?` (`DiffUtilityConfig`): Options for comparing the documents with the diff utility
  - `simplifyChanges?` (`boolean`): Whether to simplify the changes. If `true`, the changes will be simplified so that, for example, two changes in the same word are merged into a single change. Only applies when mode is 'detailed'. Default: `true`
  - `ignoreAttributes?` (`string[]`): The attributes to ignore. Default: `['id', 'data-thread-id']`
  - `ignoreMarks?` (`string[]`): The marks to ignore. Default: `['inlineThread']`
  - `changeMergeDistance?` (`number | null`): Maximum distance (in document positions) between changes to merge them. If two adjacent changes have a distance less than or equal to this value in either rangeA or rangeB, they will be merged into a single change. Set to `null` or `undefined` to disable merging. Only applies when mode is 'detailed'. Default: `null`
  - `mode?` (`'detailed' | 'block'`): The diff mode to use for comparison. `'detailed'` performs character-level diff that identifies precise changes within text (default). `'block'` performs block-level diff that treats each top-level node as a single unit. Block mode is useful when you only need to know which paragraphs, headings, or other block-level elements have changed, without character-level detail. In block mode, `simplifyChanges` and `changeMergeDistance` options are ignored. Default: `'detailed'`

<Callout title="Schema issue" variant="warning">
  The `doc` parameter must have the same schema as the current document. If `doc` comes from a
  different editor, convert it to the target editor schema: `doc: Node.fromJSON(editor.state.schema,
  otherEditor.getJSON())`

Values represent **absolute document positions** (starting from 0 at the beginning of the document), using **character offsets** (not node positions). If not provided, the entire document will be processed.
  - `diffUtilityConfig?` (`DiffUtilityConfig`): Options for comparing the documents with the diff utility
    - `simplifyChanges?` (`boolean`): Whether to simplify the changes. If `true`, the changes will be simplified so that, for example, two changes in the same word are merged into a single change. Default: `true`
