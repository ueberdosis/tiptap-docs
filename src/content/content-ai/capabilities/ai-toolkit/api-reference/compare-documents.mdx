Compare two documents in real time and show the diff in the editor.

<Callout title="Works in non-AI use cases">
  This feature does not need AI to work. It can compare any two documents, regardless of whether
  they are AI-generated or not. A common use case is to compare documents before and after an AI
  edits them. See the [Review changes
  guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/agents/review-changes-as-summary).
</Callout>

For a step-by-step guide on comparing documents, see the [Compare documents guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/compare-documents).

## API Reference

## `startComparingDocuments`

Starts real-time comparison with another document. Differences are displayed as suggestions in an inline diff view where the old and the new content are displayed in the editor.

### Parameters (`StartComparingDocumentsOptions`)

- `otherDoc?` (`Node`): The document to compare against. It is a [ProseMirror Node object](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node). Defaults to a snapshot of the current document if omitted
- `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions`): Controls how differences are rendered as suggestions
  - `showReplacement?` (`boolean`): Show replacement content as a diff widget. Default: `true` in comparison flows
  - `hideCurrentContent?` (`boolean`): Hide the current content in the diff widget. Default: `false`
  - `showSubChanges?` (`boolean`): Show sub-changes when an inline group is displayed. Default: `true`
  - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Attributes added to rendered elements
  - `replacementAttributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra attributes for the replacement decoration
  - `subChangeAttributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra attributes for inline sub-change highlights
  - `replacementSubChangeAttributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra attributes for sub-change highlights inside replacement content
  - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations`): Custom rendering function
- `debounceTimeout?` (`number`): Milliseconds to wait before recomputing diffs. A low value will make the app seem more responsive, but it might cause performance issues in large documents. Default: `500`
- `diffUtilityOptions?` ([`ExternalDiffUtilityOptions`](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/diff-utility#parameters-diffutilityoptions)): Options for comparing the documents with the diff utility. [See available options](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/diff-utility#parameters-diffutilityoptions).

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing changes with another document
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc,
})
```

## `stopComparingDocuments`

Stops the real-time comparison and clears all suggestions, so the diff view is no longer visible.

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Stop comparison and clear decorations
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```

## Accepting and rejecting changes

When comparing documents, changes are displayed as suggestions. To accept or reject individual changes or all changes at once, use the suggestion methods:

- [`acceptSuggestion`](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions#acceptsuggestion): Accept a specific change
- [`rejectSuggestion`](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions#rejectsuggestion): Reject a specific change
- [`acceptAllSuggestions`](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions#acceptallsuggestions): Accept all changes
- [`rejectAllSuggestions`](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions#rejectallsuggestions): Reject all changes

These methods work with both regular suggestions and changes from the Compare Documents feature.

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing documents
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc: otherDoc,
})

// Get all changes (as suggestions)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Accept the first change and get feedback
if (suggestions.length > 0) {
  const result = toolkit.acceptSuggestion(suggestions[0].id)
  console.log(result.aiFeedback.events)
}

// Or reject all changes at once
const result = toolkit.rejectAllSuggestions()
console.log(result.aiFeedback.events)
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```
