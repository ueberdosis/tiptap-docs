When the AI makes changes to the document, you can display them as [suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions) in the editor. In this guide, you'll learn how to customize the suggestions' appearance by modifying their styles and displaying custom elements like menus inside them.

## Add CSS styles to suggestions

When the default `renderDecorations` function is used, the following classes are applied:

- `.tiptap-ai-suggestion`: Applied on the content that is covered by the suggestion range.
- `.tiptap-ai-suggestion--selected`: Applied when the cursor is inside the suggestion range.
- `.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff`: Applied on the diff widget that is displayed next to the suggestion range.
- `.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff--selected`: Applied to the diff widget when the cursor is inside the suggestion range.

Use the above classes to style the suggestions, or provide a custom `renderDecorations` function for full control over the UI.

### Render React components inside a suggestion

You can use the `renderDecorations` option, combined with [React portals](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal), to display a React component inside a suggestion.

First, define a React component with a hook to store the HTML element where the React Portal will be rendered.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function MyComponent() {
  const [portalElement, setPortalElement] = useState<HTMLElement | null>(null)

  return null
}
```

Then, in the `displayOptions.renderDecorations` option, create a widget decoration with a HTML element that will be used as the entry point of the React portal.

```tsx
const aiToolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)
// Example method of the AI Toolkit that generates suggestions
aiToolkit.executeTool({
  reviewOptions: {
  mode: 'preview',
  displayOptions: {
    renderDecorations({ suggestion, defaultRenderDecorations }) {
  const decorations = defaultRenderDecorations()
  decorations.push(
  Decoration.widget(suggestion.range.to, () => {
    const element = document.createElement('span')
    setPortalElement(element)
    return element
  }),
  )
  return decorations
    },
  },
  },
})
```

Finally, in the React component, render any React elements inside the portal.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'

function MyComponent() {
  const [portalElement, setPortalElement] = useState<HTMLElement | null>(null)

  if (portalElement) {
  return <>{createPortal(<div>Hello, world!</div>, portalElement)}</>
  }
  return null
}
```

## Show a popover or a tooltip when a suggestion is selected

You can use the technique explained above to show a tooltip when a suggestion is selected.

To show a popover when you select a suggestion, you need to use the `getCustomSuggestionDecoration` option. This function allows you to add custom elements to the suggestions, including popovers.

Below is a simplified example on how to do it with the React UI library.

```tsx
import { useState } from 'react'
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom'

// Inside the React component
function MyComponent() {
  const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

  // First, define a hook to store the HTML element where the popover will be rendered
  const [popoverElement, setPopoverElement] = useState<HTMLElement | null>(null)

  // When the tool is executed, configure how the decorations are rendered
  aiToolkit.executeTool({
  reviewOptions: {
    mode: 'preview',
    displayOptions: {
  renderDecorations({ suggestion, defaultRenderDecorations }) {
  const decorations = defaultRenderDecorations()

  // Then, create a Prosemirror decoration that contains the HTML element
  decorations.push(
    Decoration.widget(suggestion.range.to, () => {
    const element = document.createElement('span')

    setPopoverElement(element)
    return element
    }),
  )

  return decorations
  },
    },
  },
  })

  const selectedSuggestion = toolkit.getSelectedSuggestion()

  if (popoverElement && selectedSuggestion) {
  // Then, add the content to the custom element. In this example, we use React Portals to render the popover.
  return <>{createPortal(<Popover suggestion={selectedSuggestion} />, popoverElement)}</>
  }

  return null
}
```

We recommend using the [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/) library to display the popover.

When you render the suggestion in the popover, use the `getNextWord` and `getPreviousWord` utility functions to show the previous and next words of the sentence where the suggestion is located.

```ts
import { getNextWord, getPreviousWord } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit'

// Get the previous word in the sentence.
const { previousWord } = getPreviousWord(editor, suggestion.range.from)
// Get the next word in the sentence and the punctuation mark that follows it, if it's the end of the sentence.
const { nextWord, punctuationMark } = getNextWord(editor, suggestion.range.to)
```

## Display suggestions in a sidebar outside the editor

You can access the current suggestions from the AI Toolkit's `getSuggestions` method.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()
```

Then, you can use this data to render suggestions in the UI, outside the editor. Here is an example of how to do it with the React UI library:

```tsx
// Get the suggestions from the AI Toolkit
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Render the suggestions in the UI
return (
  <div>
  {suggestions.map((suggestion) => (
    <div key={suggestion.id}>
  <p>Delete: {toolkit.getTextRange(suggestion.range)}</p>
  <p>Add: {suggestion.replacementOptions[0].addSlice.toString()}</p>
    </div>
  ))}
  </div>
)
```
