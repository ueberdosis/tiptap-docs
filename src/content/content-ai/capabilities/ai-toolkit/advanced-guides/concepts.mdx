Understand the basic concepts that will help you work with the AI Toolkit.

## Position

The AI Toolkit methods allow you to [read](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/read-document) and [edit](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/edit-document) the document at specific positions.

Positions allow you to locate elements in the document. They are represented as an integer.

The first position in the document is 0. The last position in the document is equal to the document content size.

```ts
const position = 0
const lastPosition = editor.state.doc.content.size
```

The position of the cursor can be obtained using the `selection` property of the editor state.

```ts
const position = editor.state.selection.head
```

A [range](/editor/core-concepts/range) is a pair of positions. It represents a contiguous range of content in the document.

## Range

A range is a pair of positions. It represents a contiguous range of content in the document.

```ts
import { Range } from '@tiptap/core'

const range: Range = { from: 0, to: 100 }
```

The range of the entire document is:

```ts
const range = { from: 0, to: editor.doc.content.size }
```

You can get the range of the selection using the `selection` property of the editor state.

```ts
const range = { from: editor.state.selection.from, to: editor.state.selection.to }
```

You can insert or read content at a specific position or range.

```ts
const range: Range = { from: 0, to: 100 }

// Read the document
editor.commands.tiptapRead({ range })

editor.commands.insertHtml(
  '<p>AI-generated content</p>',
  {
    position: range,
  }
})
```

Ranges are used to determine the position of [suggestions](#suggestions).

## Suggestion

A suggestion represents a proposed change to the document. When the AI makes a change to the document, you can show it as a suggestion so that the user can review and accept or reject it. Learn more about suggestions in the [Suggestions guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/advanced-guides/suggestions).

## Tiptap Read and Tiptap Edit

Tiptap Edit is a format developed by Tiptap that allows AI to edit the document efficiently and accurately. With it, the AI can make small, precise edits fast, without replacing the whole document. It enables a reduction in token usage of up to 95%.

Tiptap Edit is available as a [tool](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/agents/tools) for AI agents to use. It is also available as a [workflow](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/tiptap-edit).

For Tiptap Edit to work, you need to read the document with Tiptap Read first. Tiptap Read is available as a [tool](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/agents/tools) for AI agents to use, or as a [workflow](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/tiptap-edit).

```ts
const { content } = toolkit.tiptapRead()
toolkit.tiptapEdit({ content })
```
