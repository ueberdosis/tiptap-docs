<Callout title="Works in non-AI use cases">
  This feature does not need AI to work. It can compare any two documents, regardless of whether
  they are AI-generated or not. A common use case is to compare documents before and after an AI
  edits them. See the [Review changes
  guide](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/guides/review-changes-as-summary).

## Guide: compare two documents

Start by calling the `startComparingDocuments` method. It compares the current document of the editor with another document of your choice. The method takes one parameter: `otherDoc`, the document to compare against.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

// Start comparing changes with another document
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc,
})
```

If `otherDoc` is not provided, the AI Toolkit will start tracking the changes in the current document from the moment that `startComparingDocuments` was called, and display a diff of the document before and after the changes.

The diff is displayed as [suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions) in the editor. Add this CSS file to your app to format suggestions as a red and green diff:

```css
/* Highlight inserted text in green */
.tiptap-ai-suggestion,
.tiptap-ai-suggestion > * {
  background-color: oklch(87.1% 0.15 154.449);
}

/* Highlight deleted text in red */
.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff,
.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff > * {
  background-color: oklch(80.8% 0.114 19.571);
}
```

Call `getSuggestions` to get a list of each individual change between the documents, stored as [suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/api-reference/display-suggestions). Then, call `acceptSuggestion` or `rejectSuggestion` to accept or reject them individually.

```ts
// Get all changes (as suggestions)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Accept the first change
toolkit.acceptSuggestion(suggestions[0].id)

// Reject the first change
toolkit.rejectSuggestion(suggestions[0].id)

// Accept all changes
toolkit.acceptAllSuggestions()

// Reject all changes
toolkit.rejectAllSuggestions()
```

To stop comparing documents, use the `stopComparingDocuments` method. It hides the diff view and clears the suggestions.

```ts
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```

## Example demo

Below is a demo of how to compare two documents in real time.

<CodeDemo
  isPro
  isLarge
  path="/Extensions/AiToolkitCompareDocuments"
  src="https://deploy-preview-405--tiptap-pro.netlify.app/preview/Extensions/AiToolkitCompareDocuments"
/>

Try clicking the "Start comparing documents" button, and a diff will appear. Then, try editing the document and see the diff change.
