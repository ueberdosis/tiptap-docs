import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

## `diffUtility`

Compares two Tiptap documents and returns a list of changes between them.

### Parameters (`DiffUtilityOptions`)

- `docA` (`Node`): Original document
- `docB` (`Node`): Modified document
- `simplifyChanges?` (`boolean`): Whether to simplify the changes so that if there are multiple changes in the same word, they are merged into one change. Default: `true`

<Callout title="Schema issue" variant="warning">
  Both documents must have the same schema. If the documents come from different editors, convert
  them to a common editor schema: `Node.fromJSON(editor.state.schema, otherEditor.getJSON())`
</Callout>

### Returns (`Change[]`)

Returns a list of changes. Each `Change` item contains:

- `rangeA` (`Range`): The range in the original document that has changed
- `rangeB` (`Range`): The range in the modified document that has changed

### Example

```ts
// Compute changes between two documents
import { diffUtility } from '@tiptap-pro/ai-toolkit'
const changes = diffUtility({ docA, docB })
```
