The AI Toolkit provides primitives to edit the document in different formats.

## `insertText`

Insert plain text into the editor.

### Parameters

- `content` (`string`): Text to insert
- `options?` (`InsertTextOptions`): Options for the `insertText` method
  - `position?` (`InsertPosition`): Where to insert. [See options](#insertposition-type). Default: `'selection'`
  - `reviewOptions?` (`ReviewOptions`): Control preview/review behavior
    - `mode?` (`'disabled' | 'review' | 'preview'`): Whether to review the changes before or after applying them. `'disabled'` means no review, `'review'` means review after applying, `'preview'` means preview before applying. Default: `'disabled'`
    - `diffMode?` (`'detailed' | 'full'`): How to display the difference between the original and the modified content, when review mode is enabled. `'detailed'` compares the documents before and after the change and displays the deleted content and added content as a rich diff. `'full'` displays the deleted content and added content in a whole block, as a single change containing the deleted and added content. Default: `'detailed'`
    - `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Customize how suggestions are displayed
      - `showAsDiff?` (`boolean`): Whether to show the suggestion as a diff where inserted and original content are displayed side by side. Default: `true`
      - `diffPosition?` (`'before' | 'after'`): The position of the diff relative to the suggestion. Default: `'before'`
      - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra HTML attributes to be added to the suggestion
      - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): A function to render the suggestion as ProseMirror decorations
    - `metadata?` (`Record<string, any>`): Extra metadata for the suggestions that can be used to store additional information about them (e.g. their source or their category). It is not used internally by the extension but it may help developers customize how the suggestions are displayed in the UI.
    - `changeMergeDistance?` (`number`): Maximum distance (in document positions) between changes to merge them when comparing documents. If two adjacent changes have a distance less than or equal to this value in either rangeA or rangeB, they will be merged into a single change. Set to 0 to disable merging. Default: `0`

#### `PatchOperation` (type)

A `PatchOperation` can be one of two types:

`JumpOperation`: A navigation operation that moves the cursor to a specific context in the document.

- `type` (`'jump'`): The operation type identifier
- `context` (`string`): The context string to search for and position the cursor after

`ReplaceOperation`: A replace operation that deletes and inserts text at the current cursor position.

Replace operations perform the actual content modifications by removing specified text and replacing it with new text. The delete text must be found at the current cursor position for the operation to succeed.

- `type` (`'replace'`): The operation type identifier
- `delete` (`string`): The exact text to delete from the document (can be empty for pure insertions)
- `insert` (`string`): The text to insert in place of the deleted text

### Returns (`ApplyHtmlPatchResult`)

- `docChanged` (`boolean`): Whether the document was modified
- `error` (`ApplyPatchError | null`): Error if the diff application failed because not all diffs could be applied, null if successful

The method can edit the document but return an error at the same time. This happens when some operations are applied but some fail.

#### `ApplyPatchError` (type)

Error thrown when applying a Universal Patch Format operation fails. This error provides comprehensive context about the failure, including which operation failed, what operations succeeded before it, and the current state of the content.

- `operationIndex` (`number`): The zero-based index of the operation that failed
- `previousOperations` (`PatchOperation[]`): Array of operations that were successfully applied before the failure
- `operation` (`PatchOperation`): The operation that failed to apply
- `contentAfterCursor` (`string`): The content after the current cursor position when the error occurred

### Example

```ts
// Replace "fine" with emphasized "great" in the first chunk
toolkit.applyHtmlPatch([{ type: 'replace', delete: 'fine', insert: '<em>great</em>' }])
```

---

## `InsertPosition` (type)

The position where the content will be inserted. It can be one of the following values:

- `Range`: A range of the document
- `number`: A position in the document
- `'selection'`: Replace the current selection with the new content
- `'selectionStart'`: The start of the current selection
- `'selectionEnd'`: The end of the current selection
- `'document'`: Replace the entire document with the new content
- `'documentStart'`: The start of the document
- `'documentEnd'`: The end of the document
