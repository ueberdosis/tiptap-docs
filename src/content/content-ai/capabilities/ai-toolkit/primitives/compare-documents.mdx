Compare two documents in real time and show the diff in the editor.

## Guide: compare two documents

Start by calling the `startComparingDocuments` method. It compares the current document of the editor with another document of your choice. The method takes one parameter: `otherDoc`, the document to compare against.

```ts
const toolkit = getAiToolkit(editor)

// Start comparing changes with another document
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc,
})
```

If `otherDoc` is not provided, the AI Toolkit will start tracking the changes in the current document from the moment that `startComparingDocuments` was called, and display a diff of the document before and after the changes.

The diff is displayed as [suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions) in the editor. Add this CSS file to your app to format suggestions as a red and green diff:

```css
/* Highlight inserted text in green */
.tiptap-ai-suggestion,
.tiptap-ai-suggestion > * {
  background-color: oklch(87.1% 0.15 154.449);
}

/* Highlight deleted text in red */
.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff,
.tiptap-ai-suggestion-diff > * {
  background-color: oklch(80.8% 0.114 19.571);
}
```

Call `getSuggestions` to get a list of each individual change between the documents, stored as [suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/primitives/display-suggestions). Then, call `acceptChange` or `rejectChange` to accept or reject them individually.

```ts
// Get all changes (as suggestions)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Accept the first change
toolkit.acceptChange(suggestions[0].id)

// Reject the first change
toolkit.rejectChange(suggestions[0].id)
```

To stop comparing documents, use the `stopComparingDocuments` method. It hides the diff view and clears the suggestions.

```ts
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```

## Example demo

Below is a demo of how to compare two documents in real time.

<CodeDemo
  isPro
  isLarge
  path="/Extensions/AiToolkitCompareDocuments"
  src="https://deploy-preview-405--tiptap-pro.netlify.app/preview/Extensions/AiToolkitCompareDocuments"
/>

Try clicking the "Start comparing documents" button, and a diff will appear. Then, try editing the document and see the diff change.

## API reference

## `startComparingDocuments`

Starts real-time comparison with another document. Differences are displayed as suggestions in an inline diff view where the old and the new content are displayed in the editor.

### Parameters (`StartComparingDocumentsOptions`)

- `otherDoc?` (`Node`): The document to compare against. It is a [ProseMirror Node object](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node). Defaults to a snapshot of the current document if omitted
- `displayOptions?` (`DisplayOptions<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Controls how differences are rendered as suggestions
  - `showAsDiff?` (`boolean`): Show alternative content as a diff widget. Default: `true` in comparison flows
  - `diffPosition?` (`'before' | 'after'`): Where to display the diff relative to the suggestion. Default: `'before'`
  - `attributes?` (`Record<string, any>`): Attributes added to rendered elements
  - `renderDecorations?` (`RenderDecorations<{ suggestion: Suggestion }>`): Custom rendering function
- `debounceTimeout?` (`number`): Milliseconds to wait before recomputing diffs. A low value will make the app seem more responsive, but it might cause performance issues in large documents. Default: `500`

<Callout title="Schema issue" variant="warning">
  The `otherDoc` parameter must have the same schema as the current document. If the other document
  comes from another editor, convert it to the target editor schema: `otherDoc:
  Node.fromJSON(editor.state.schema, otherEditor.getJSON())`. See example in the demo above.
</Callout>

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing changes with another document
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc,
})
```

## `stopComparingDocuments`

Stops the real-time comparison and clears all suggestions, so the diff view is no longer visible.

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Stop comparison and clear decorations
toolkit.stopComparingDocuments()
```

## `acceptChange`

Accepts a change so that it is no longer visible in the diff when comparing documents in real-time.

This is equivalent to applying a specific suggestion by its ID to the other document. The "other document" or `otherDoc` is the document that is being compared to the current document.

To accept all changes, call `stopComparingDocuments`. This will hide the diff view, as if all changes had been accepted.

### Parameters

- `suggestionId` (`string`): The unique identifier of the suggestion that represents the change to accept

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing documents
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc: otherDoc,
})

// Get all changes (as suggestions)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Accept the first change
toolkit.acceptChange(suggestions[0].id)
```

## `rejectChange`

Rejects a change so that it is no longer visible in the diff when comparing documents in real-time.

This is equivalent to applying a specific suggestion by its ID to the current document.

### Parameters

- `suggestionId` (`string`): The unique identifier of the suggestion that represents the change to reject

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing documents
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc: otherDoc,
})

// Get all changes (as suggestions)
const suggestions = toolkit.getSuggestions()

// Reject the first change
toolkit.rejectChange(suggestions[0].id)
```

## `rejectAllChanges`

Rejects all changes so that they are no longer visible in the diff when comparing documents in real-time.

This is equivalent to setting the current document to the `otherDoc`.

### Returns

`void`

### Example

```ts
// Start comparing documents
toolkit.startComparingDocuments({
  otherDoc: otherDoc,
})

// Reject all changes
toolkit.rejectAllChanges()
```
