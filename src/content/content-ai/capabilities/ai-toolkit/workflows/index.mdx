Workflows are scenarios where the AI model has a single, well-defined task. The AI Toolkit includes these built-in workflows:

- [Insert content](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/insert-content).
- [Proofreader](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/proofreader).
- [Tiptap Edit](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/tiptap-edit).
- [Comments](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/workflows/comments).

Each built-in workflow includes

1. A ready-to-use prompt for the AI model.
2. A method to execute the workflow and apply the edits to the Tiptap Editor.

Built-in workflows can be configured and extended. Additionally, you can create your own workflows from scratch with the AI Toolkit primitives.

## Workflows vs. AI Agents

In AI agents, the AI model can choose from a set of tools to perform a task. Workflows, on the other hand, only allow the AI model to perform a single action like, for example, generating edits or re-writing the document.

In general, workflows are simpler and faster to implement than AI agent tools. However, AI agents are more flexible and can be used to perform more complex tasks.
