  category: Content AI
---

Configure a review workflow to give users more control over AI-generated content. The AI Agent extension integrates with the [AI Changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/overview) and [AI Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/overview) extensions to help users approve, reject, and modify AI-generated content.

There are two ways of handling AI-generated changes:

- [**Review after applying**](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/review/ai-changes): Changes are applied to the document, and then reviewed with the **AI Changes** extension. Users can then accept or reject the changes. Rejecting a change will revert the document to its previous content. Follow [this guide](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/review/ai-changes) to configure.
- [**Preview before applying**](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/review/ai-suggestion): Changes are sent to the **AI Suggestion** extension, where users can review and approve or reject them before they are applied to the document. Follow [this guide](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/review/ai-suggestion) to configure.

## Auto-accept configuration

When the AI agent calls a tool, you might want it to stop and wait for user review, or continue running without user interaction.

You can configure this behaviour with the `autoAccept` option. It controls whether the AI agent should automatically accept any tool call and continue running, or whether it should stop and wait for user review.

- `"always"`: All tools are automatically applied without review. The AI agent will run non-stop, until it completes its task.
- `"never"`: All tools require user review and explicit acceptance
- `"onlyRead"`: Only tools that modify the editor content require review; read operations are auto-accepted.

```tsx
// Configure auto-accept behavior
const provider = new AiAgentProvider({
  reviewOptions: {
    autoAccept: 'onlyRead',
  },
  // ... other options
})

// Change auto-accept behavior at runtime
provider.setAutoAccept('never')
```
