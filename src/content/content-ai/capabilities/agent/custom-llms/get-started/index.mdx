This guide explains how to set up the AI Agent extension with a custom AI agent running in your backend.

The guide has different versions depending on the AI library you use:

- [Vercel AI SDK](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started/vercel-ai-sdk)
- [OpenAI Chat Completions API](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started/openai-chat-completions)
- [OpenAI Responses API](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started/openai-responses)
- [Anthropic Claude Messages API](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started/anthropic-messages)

Don't know what library to use? Start with the [Vercel AI SDK](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started/vercel-ai-sdk). It lets you switch [AI providers](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers), so you can try and see which works best for you.
