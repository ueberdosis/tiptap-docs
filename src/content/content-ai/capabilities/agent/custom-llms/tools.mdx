Tools are the building blocks of an AI agent. They define the actions that the AI model can take to interact with its environment.

The Tiptap AI Agent extension provides a set of built-in tools that give your AI agent the ability to read and edit rich text documents.

Although the AI Agent extension provides a set of built-in tools, you can also [define custom tools](#custom-tools) to extend your AI agent's capabilities.

## Built-in tools

### `read_first_chunk`

Starts reading the current document from the beginning.

### `read_next_chunk`

Reads the next chunk of the document.

### `read_previous_chunk`

Reads the previous chunk of the document.

### `apply_diff`

This is the main tool the AI agent has for making changes to the document. It applies a list of diffs to the document. Each diff contains:

- The content before the change, used to locate the place to edit.
- The content to delete
- The content to insert

### `replace_document`

Replaces the entire document with new content.

### `plan`

Plans the work to be done. It generates a list of steps in Markdown format.

### `ask_user`

Asks the user a question.

### `finish_with_summary`

Marks the task as completed, and provides a summary in Markdown format.

## Customize built-in tools

You can remove or replace the built-in tools by configuring the `AiAgentToolkit` instance.

```ts
import {
  AiAgentToolkit,
  planTool,
  askUserTool,
  readFirstChunkTool,
  readNextChunkTool,
  readPreviousChunkTool,
  replaceDocumentTool,
  finishWithSummaryTool,
  applyDiffTool,
} from '@tiptap-pro/extension-ai-agent-server'

const toolkit = new AiAgentToolkit({
  tools: [
    // These are all the built-in tools. Remove or replace them as needed.
    planTool(),
    askUserTool(),
    readFirstChunkTool(),
    readNextChunkTool(),
    readPreviousChunkTool(),
    replaceDocumentTool(),
    finishWithSummaryTool(),
    applyDiffTool(),
  ],
})
```

## Custom tools

Besides the built-in tools, you can define additional tools. There are two types of custom tools:

- [**Client-side tools**](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/client-side-tools) run in the client. They interact with the editor's content. For example: a tool that counts the number of words in the document, or a tool that formats the document. All built-in tools are client-side tools.
- [**Server-side tools**](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/server-side-tools) run in the server. They interact with external data sources. For example: a tool that searches the web, or a tool that queries a database.
