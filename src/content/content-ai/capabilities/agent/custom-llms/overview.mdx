Like other Tiptap AI Extensions, the AI Agent extension can be used in two ways:

- With Tiptap Cloud: Includes a managed AI agent. Works out of the box, no server setup required.
- With your own AI agent: Add text-editing capabilities to your custom AI agent that runs in your backend.

This guide explains when to use each option.

## Tiptap Cloud

Using the AI Agent extension with Tiptap Cloud is the fastest way to get started. It eliminates the need to build and maintain your own server.

Tiptap Cloud's AI agent is highly configurable:

- Customize how the AI agent behaves, by editing the [system prompt](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/configure/system-prompt). Define multiple AI Agents, each with their own rules and personality.
- [Provide context](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/features/context) to the user messages.
- [Customize the AI model](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud#customize-the-openai-model). Only OpenAI models are supported in Tiptap Cloud.

Tiptap Cloud's AI agent is the recommended option for beginners. To get started, [follow this guide](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud).

## Custom AI agent

<Callout title="Beginner's tip" variant="info">
  Building an AI agent for the first time? Start with [Tiptap Cloud's AI
  Agent](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/use-with-content-ai-cloud), then migrate to a custom AI
  Agent when you need more features.
</Callout>

A custom AI agent gives you more control over the AI model and tools. Use it in these situations:

- If you've already built an AI agent and want to add text-editing capabilities to it.
- To use an AI model that is not supported in Tiptap Cloud.
- To create an AI agent with [custom tools](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/tools) that interact with external data sources. For example, a tool that searches the web for information.

However, a custom AI agent requires more work to set up and maintain. You need to build and maintain your own backend.

To get started with a custom AI agent, [follow this guide](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/get-started).
