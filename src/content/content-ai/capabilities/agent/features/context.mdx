In AI Agents, context is data that complements the user's request. Sometimes, it's essential to help it complete the task.

For example, in a multi-document AI agent, if the user mentions a document, the document's ID should be sent as context, too.

Provide context when you create a user message by using the `context` option.

```ts
provider.addUserMessage('Summarize the selected document', {
  context: 'The selected document ID is: 12345',
})
```

## Insert context with mentions

In many AI chatbots, users can reference files and other users by mentioning them: `@John`, `#file-123`, etc. You can implement this behaviour with Tiptap by defining
the prompt input as a Tiptap text editor, and installing the [Mention extension](/editor/extensions/nodes/mention).

## Add files and URLs to context

The `context` option only accepts strings, not file objects. To add files as context, follow the steps below:

1. Upload the file to your server. Obtain an identifier for it.
2. Add the file identifier to the `context` option.
3. In [your backend](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms), define a [custom server-side tool](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/server-side-tools) that lets your AI agent read the contents of the file.

The same applies to URLs. If the user provides a URL, you can include it as a string in the `context` option and define a [custom tool](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/custom-llms/server-side-tools) to search the web and retrieve the content of that URL.

## Add the editor's selection to context

To make the AI agent aware of the selected content in the editor, activate [selection awareness](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/features/selection-awareness).
