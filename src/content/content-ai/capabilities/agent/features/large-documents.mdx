The AI agent splits the document in chunks to handle documents of any size efficiently. This chunking mechanism is essential because:

1. Large documents may exceed the context window of the LLM
2. Editing chunks is more efficient for multi-turn conversations
3. It allows the AI agent to focus on specific parts of the document

## Chunking mechanism

By default, the document is split into chunks of approximately 32000 characters each, while preserving HTML structure. The AI agent reads one chunk at a time and can navigate to the next or previous chunk as needed.

Customize the amount of characters per chunk by setting the `chunkSize` option:

```tsx
const provider = new AiAgentProvider({
  chunkSize: 2000, // Define a smaller chunk size
  // ...other options
})
```

## Custom chunking

You can customize how the document is chunked by providing a custom `chunkHtml` function:

```tsx
const provider = new AiAgentProvider({
  // ...other options
  chunkHtml: ({ html, chunkSize }) => {
    // Custom logic to split HTML into chunks
    // Must return an array of HTML strings
    return customSplitFunction(html, chunkSize)
  },
})
```
