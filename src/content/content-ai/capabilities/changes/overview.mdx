The AI Changes extension enables you to track, review, and manage content modifications made by AI in your editor. It clearly highlights changes, making it easy to see what has been added or removed.

Combine it with the [AI Generation extension](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview) to create content and provide your users with a seamless review workflow.

## AI Changes features

- Integrates seamlessly with our [AI Generation extension](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/text-generation) and [AI Agent toolkit](/examples/experiments/ai-agent)
- Supports rich text formatting, including images, links, and mentions
- Enables users to [accept and reject individual changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/review-changes) or make adjustments to generated content
- Provides a [fully customizable UI](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes) for displaying changes

<Callout title="When to use AI Changes?" variant="warning">
  The AI Changes extension displays changes **after** they are applied to the document. To preview
  changes before they are applied, use the [AI
  Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/overview) extension. Follow the [diff
  view](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/features/diff-view) guide.
</Callout>

## How it works

The AI Changes extension adapts to your specific text editing workflow. Integrate it in four simple steps:

1. [Install](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/install) and [configure](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/configure) the extension
2. Edit the editor's content (for example, by inserting AI-generated text)
3. [Display changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/display-changes) in the editor
4. [Review changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/features/review-changes) made by AI
