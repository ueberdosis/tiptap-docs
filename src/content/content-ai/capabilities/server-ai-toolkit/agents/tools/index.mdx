The Server AI Toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Tiptap documents on the server. These tools enable reading content and making edits efficiently.

When you call the Server AI Toolkit API endpoints, the AI model can generate tool calls that are then executed using the `/v2/toolkit/execute-tool` endpoint. This allows the AI to read, edit, and manipulate documents based on user requests.

<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
  Provider-specific tool definitions (for Vercel AI SDK, LangChain.js, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) are
  coming soon. Currently, you need to get the tool definitions from the Server AI Toolkit API and
  convert them to your provider's format.
