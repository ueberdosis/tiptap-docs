The Server AI Toolkit provides a comprehensive set of tools for interacting with Tiptap documents on the server.

When you provide these tools to your AI agent, it will generate tool calls that are executed using the `/v3/ai/toolkit/execute-tool` endpoint. This allows the AI to read and edit documents.

See the [API reference](/content-ai/capabilities/server-ai-toolkit/api-reference/rest-api) for more information on the endpoints to retrieve and execute tools.

<Callout title="Note" variant="info">
  Upcoming releases will include provider-specific tool definitions (for Vercel AI SDK,
  LangChain.js, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Currently, you need to get the tool definitions from the
  Server AI Toolkit API in a generic format, and convert them to your provider's format.
