  description: Complete list of AI agent tools for reading and editing document content on the server.
  category: Content AI
---

The Server AI Toolkit provides tools for interacting with Tiptap documents on the server. These tools enable reading content and making edits efficiently.

The tool definitions are available in the format of popular AI provider libraries:

- [Vercel AI SDK](/content-ai/capabilities/server-ai-toolkit/tools/ai-sdk)
- [Other providers](/content-ai/capabilities/server-ai-toolkit/tools/other-providers)

When you add the tool definitions to your AI provider library, your AI agent will generate tool calls. You can then execute the tool calls using the [`executeTool` method](/content-ai/capabilities/server-ai-toolkit/primitives/execute-tool).

```typescript
// Execute a tool to read nodes
await toolkit.executeTool({
  toolName: 'tiptapReadV1',
  input: { from: 0 },
})
```

## `tiptapReadV1`

Read a range of top-level nodes from the document. This tool allows efficient processing of large documents, so that, if the document is too large, the context window of the AI model is not exceeded. The AI can precisely jump to specific positions in the document, to see their content and edit them.

### Parameters

- `from` (`number`): The index of the first node to read

If the requested range is too large, the Server AI Toolkit reads the first part of it, and informs the AI of what part of the document was actually read. If the range is outside the bounds of the document, the Server AI Toolkit handles it gracefully and informs the AI model of the mistake.

### Result

- `totalNodeCount`: The total number of top-level nodes in the document
- `nodeRange`: The range of nodes that were read
- `nodes`: The content of the nodes that were read

## `tiptapEditV1`

Edit nodes in the document. Supports operations to replace, insert before, and insert after specific nodes.

Follows a proprietary format that allows the AI to generate edits efficiently, without needing to understand ProseMirror positions. We share more details about this format with selected Server AI Toolkit customers, to help them leverage it for their custom document editing use cases. [Contact us](mailto:humans@tiptap.dev) to learn more.

### Parameters

- `operations` (`array`): Array of operations to perform

### Result

A success message if the operations were successful, or an error message if they were not.
