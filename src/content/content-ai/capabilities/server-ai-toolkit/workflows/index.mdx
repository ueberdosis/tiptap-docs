<Callout title="Coming soon" variant="info">
  Support for workflows in the Server AI Toolkit is coming soon. Workflows will allow you to perform
  simple document editing tasks like inserting content, proofreading, and more on the server.
</Callout>

Workflows provide a simpler way to perform single, well-defined tasks on Tiptap documents. Unlike AI agents that can choose from multiple tools, workflows focus on a single action, making them faster and easier to implement.

Once available, Server AI Toolkit workflows will include:

- **Insert content**: Insert content in a single place of the document
- **Proofreader**: Correct mistakes like spelling and grammar
- **Tiptap Edit**: A general-purpose workflow for making small and large edits to Tiptap documents
- **Comments**: Manage comments and threads in your Tiptap documents
