Work with Tiptap documents on the server. The Server AI Toolkit includes the tools your AI needs to edit documents in the background, without a browser environment.

## Core capabilities

The Server AI Toolkit provides server-side equivalents of the AI Toolkit functionality.

### AI Agent Tools

Pre-built tool definitions that your AI agent can call to interact with documents on the server. These work with popular frameworks like Vercel AI SDK and provide a generic format for other providers.

### Workflows

Methods for building custom server-side AI automations.

- Proofreading the document
- Adding comments
- Replace content or make focused edits
- Summarizing and analyzing documents.

### Schema awareness

Our Schema Awareness technology allows AI models to understand the document's structure automatically. This ensures AI to generates valid content, including custom elements.

### Tiptap Shorthand and Tiptap Edit

The Server AI Toolkit is built with efficiency in mind and adapts to cost-sensitive use cases.

It leverages our specialized edit format, Tiptap Edit, which lets AI make small, precise edits without replacing the entire document.

Tiptap Shorthand is a format that encodes document structure efficiently, helping you reduce AI token costs by up to 80% without sacrificing accuracy.

By combining Tiptap Edit with Tiptap Shorthand, you can work with documents in a way that's both fast and cost-effective.

## Deployment options

The Server AI Toolkit can be accessed as a cloud service or deployed on your own AI infrastructure.

Additionally, it will include SDKs for programming languages like TypeScript, Python, and Ruby. These SDKs will integrate with AI frameworks like the Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI SDK, and LangChain.

Access to the Server AI Toolkit includes expert support from our engineering team, to ensure a smooth integration.

### Collaboration integration

The Server AI Toolkit will integrate with [Tiptap Collaboration](/collaboration/getting-started/overview), to allow for real-time collaboration with AI agents.

Optionally, the Collaboration integration can be disabled or replaced with a custom storage solution, like a database or the file system.
