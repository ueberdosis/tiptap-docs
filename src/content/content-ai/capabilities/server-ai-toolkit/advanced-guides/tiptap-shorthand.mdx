Tiptap Shorthand is a token-efficient format for representing Tiptap documents. It reduces AI token costs by up to 80% compared to standard JSON, without sacrificing accuracy.

<Callout title="Experimental feature" variant="info">
  Tiptap Shorthand is currently an experimental feature.
</Callout>

## Set up Tiptap Shorthand

Define the format in which the AI reads and edits the document by setting the `format` parameter of the JSON body. This parameter is available on all Server AI Toolkit endpoints.

The default value of `format` is `"json"`. To enable Tiptap Shorthand, pass the `format: "shorthand"` parameter to **all** your API requests.

For example, to get the tool definitions:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.tiptap.dev/v3/toolkit/tools \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-App-Id: YOUR_APP_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "format": "shorthand",
    "schemaAwarenessData": {}
  }'
```

No additional changes are required.

<Callout title="Format consistency" variant="warning">
  Use the same format value across all API calls in a conversation. Do not mix the `json` and
  `shorthand` formats within a single AI interaction.
</Callout>
