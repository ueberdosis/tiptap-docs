The [Content AI](/content-ai/getting-started/overview) suite is compatible with Tiptap's [Collaboration](/collaboration/getting-started/overview) features and extensions. In this section, we explain how AI extensions behave in a real-time collaborative environment.

## AI Generation

The [AI Generation](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview) extension uses AI models to generate content. The content will be seen by all connected users once it is inserted into the editor.

However, to preview the AI responses before they are inserted, you can [store them in the extension storage](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/text-generation/manage-responses). While in that state, the responses are not seen by other connected users. When the user accepts the response, it will be added the editor contentand visible to all connected users.

Likewise, [autocompletion suggestions](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/text-generation/autocompletion) are only visible to the user who triggered them, and they are not displayed to other users until the user accepts them.

## AI Suggestion

The [AI Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/overview) extension shows suggestions generated by AI. The suggestions are not shown to other connected users. This lets you show different suggestions to each user, based on their preferences or context. Once a suggestion is accepted, it will be inserted into the editor and made visible to all connected users.

## AI Changes

The [AI Changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/overview) extension tracks changes made by AI. The new editor content is available to all connected users as soon as it is inserted into the editor. However, the diff of the changes is not displayed to other connected users.

## AI Agent

The [AI Agent](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/overview) extension gives text-editing capabilities to your AI Agent. By default, the changes are shown to other users as soon as they are inserted into the editor. However, you can configure a [review workflow](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/review) so that changes are previewed before they are applied. In that case, the changes will not be visible to other users until the user accepts them.
