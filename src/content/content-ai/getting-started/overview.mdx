Learn how to build AI-powered editors through guides, API references, and integration examples.

## Get started

Tiptap offers two frontend extensions that integrate directly into your editor.

<div className="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-5">
  <ProductCard
    title="AI Toolkit"
    description="Provides tool definitions for AI agents to read, insert, and patch editor content. Includes document chunking, schema-aware generation, real-time streaming, and suggestion-based reviews."
    tags={['Business']}
    documentationUrl="/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/overview"
    secondaryUrl="/content-ai/capabilities/use-cases"
    secondaryButtonText="Use cases"
    icon={aiToolkitIcon.src}
    doubleWidth={true}
  />
  <ProductCard
    title="AI Generation"
    description="Executes built-in or custom text commands (summarize, rephrase, translate) with streaming responses. Includes Tab-triggered autocompletion and response management."
    tags={['Start']}
    documentationUrl="/content-ai/capabilities/generation/overview"
    secondaryUrl="/content-ai/capabilities/use-cases"
    secondaryButtonText="Use cases"
    icon={aiGenerationIcon.src}
    doubleWidth={true}
  />
</div>

## Explore use cases

Explore technical implementations for AI-powered editing. Build AI agents with document-editing capabilities like chatbots, inline edits, and proofreading, or add simple AI commands like autocompletion, translation, and summarization.

## Use your own AI infrastructure

All extensions support custom AI infrastructure where no data is sent to Tiptap:

- **AI Toolkit**: Framework-agnostic. Works with Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, OpenAI SDK, Anthropic SDK, or your own implementation. [Learn more](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/overview)

- **AI Generation**: Connect your own LLM by overriding the resolver. Alternatively, use Tiptap AI server as middleware to OpenAI (currently supports OpenAI models only). [Learn more](/content-ai/capabilities/generation/custom-llms)

**Privacy and security:** When using the Tiptap AI backend with AI Generation, learn how we handle AI data processing and content privacy in our [privacy documentation](/content-ai/resources/privacy).

## Legacy extensions

[AI Suggestion](/content-ai/capabilities/suggestion/overview), [AI Changes](/content-ai/capabilities/changes/overview), and [AI Assistant](/content-ai/capabilities/agent/overview) are being deprecated in 2026 and will be replaced by AI Toolkit. These extensions receive no new features and are maintained for existing users only.

**Migrating to AI Toolkit:** The AI Toolkit provides superior capabilities for AI agent workflows. [View migration guides](/content-ai/capabilities/ai-toolkit/migration-guides) to learn how to transition your application.
