Tiptap is a very performant editor (even able to edit an entire book!), often when you run into performance issues, it's not Tiptap itself, but the way you integrate it into your app. Here are some tips to make sure your editor runs smoothly.

## React Tiptap Editor Integration

When using Tiptap with React, the most common performance issue is that the editor is re-rendered too often. This can happen for several reasons:

- When using the `useEditor` hook, it by default will re-render the editor on every change. So, you should isolate the editor (and things that depend on it) in a separate component to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- The editor should be isolated from renders that don't affect it. For example, if you have a sidebar that doesn't interact with the editor, it should be in a separate component.

Luckily the solution for most of these issues is the same: isolate the editor in a separate component. Here is an example of how you can do this:

DO: isolate the editor in a separate component

```jsx
import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'

const TiptapEditor = () => {
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions,
    content,
  })

  return (
    <>
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      {/* Other components that depend on the editor instance */}
      <MenuComponent editor={editor} />
    </>
  )
}

export default TiptapEditor
```

DON'T: render the editor in the same component as other components

```jsx
import { EditorContent, useEditor } from '@tiptap/react'

const App = () => {
  const [sidebarOpen, setSidebarOpen] = React.useState(false)
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions,
    content,
  })

  return (
    <>
      <UnrelatedSidebar onChange={setSidebarOpen} />
      <EditorContent editor={editor} />
      <MenuComponent editor={editor} />
      <Sidenav isSidebarOpen={sidebarOpen}>
        <AnotherComponent />
      </Sidenav>
    </>
  )
}

export default App
```

These unrelated components will cause the editor to re-render more often than necessary, and make each render more expensive.

We are working on a more advanced solution to this problem, but for now, this is the best way to ensure your editor runs smoothly.
