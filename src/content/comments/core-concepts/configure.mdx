import { Callout } from '@/components/ui/Callout'

Comments are embedded within documents in the Collaboration Cloud. To enable comments, integrate the TiptapCollabProvider and configure your setup to support comment functionality.

## provider

The TiptapCollabProvider instance

Default: `null`

```js
const tiptapCollabProvider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
  // your provider options
})

Comments.configure({
  provider: tiptapCollabProvider,
})
```

## classes

The classes used for the threads.

Default:

```js
{
  thread: 'tiptap-thread',
  threadInline: 'tiptap-thread--inline',
  threadBlock: 'tiptap-thread--block',
  threadHovered: 'tiptap-thread--hovered',
  threadSelected: 'tiptap-thread--selected',
  threadResolved: 'tiptap-thread--resolved',
  threadUnresolved: 'tiptap-thread--unresolved',
}
```

```js
Comments.configure({
  classes: {
    thread: 'my-thread',
    threadInline: 'my-thread-inline',
    threadBlock: 'my-thread-block',
    threadHovered: 'my-thread-hovered',
    threadSelected: 'my-thread-selected',
    threadResolved: 'my-thread-resolved',
    threadUnresolved: 'my-thread-unresolved',
  },
})
```

## onClickThread

A callback that is called when a thread is clicked. If the thread is clicked, the id of the thread is passed to the callback. If no thread is clicked, `null` is passed.

Default: `undefined`

```js
Comments.Configure({
  // id can be a string or null
  onClickThread: (id) => console.log('Thread clicked', id),
})
```

## useLegacyWrapping

<Callout title="Warning" variant="warning">
  The new wrapping mechanism is using a different schema for block thread nodes, which is not
  compatible with the legacy wrapping mechanism. If you are using the new wrapping mechanism, you
  need to set this option to `false`. If this is set to `false` without mapping existing thread
  nodes to the new schema, the threads content will be stripped from the document.
</Callout>

A boolean option that controls whether to use the legacy wrapping mechanism for multi-line comments. This is required to support backwards compatibility with existing comments and will
be removed in the future. The default value is `true`.

The new wrapping mechanism is more flexible, allowing to wrap content more precise and supports mixed wrapping of inline and block nodes.

Default: `true`

```js
Comments.configure({
  // enable new flexible block wrapping
  useLegacyWrapping: false,
})
```
