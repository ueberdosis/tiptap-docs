<Callout title="Integrate or test Comments" variant="warning">
    To test or integrate this feature you need an [active trial or Tiptap subscription](https://cloud.tiptap.dev/v2/billing).
</Callout>

## Access the Pro registry
The Comments extension is published in Tiptap’s private npm registry. Integrate the extension by following the [private registry guide](/guides/pro-extensions).


```bash
npm install @tiptap-pro/extension-comments
```

## Integrating the Comments extension

After installing the `comments` extension via npm or any other package manager, you can use it in your editor by registering the extension in the `extensions` property of your editor instance.

The Comments extension consists of multiple components, including nodes and plugins. To include all the required features, use the `CommentsKit` extension.

```js
import { ThreadsKit } from '@tiptap-pro/extension-comments'

const editor = new Editor({
  ...
  extensions: [
    ...,
    CommentsKit,
  ]
})
```

This will add all required extensions to your editor. Since Threads are a **cloud** or **on premises** feature you will need to also pass through a `TiptapCollabProvider` instance to your comments extension.

```js
const collabProvider = new TiptapCollabProvider({
  // your provider options
})

const editor = new Editor({
  ...
  extensions: [
    ...,
    CommentsKit.configure({
      provider: collabProvider,
      useLegacyWrapping: false, // optional, will be the default in the future
    }),
  ]
})
```

Your editor is now ready to support threads.

<Callout title="Important" variant="warning">
  The new `useLegacyWrapping` option can be set to false to use a new block wrapping mechanism for
  multi-line comments. This **will become the default** in the future.
</Callout>
